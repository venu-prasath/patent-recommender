    "title": "Securities and commodities trading system",
    "abstract": "In accordance with the invention there is provided a securities trading system based on the principles of artificial intelligence. It includes a data acquisition system having an input communicating with a securities exchange for receiving securities buy/sell data; a clock for generating clock times; a processing logic having inputs respectively communicating with the data acquisition system and with the clock for assigning respective clock times to said buy/sell data; a decision logic having a repository for storing a set of buy/sell rules for buying and selling securities in response to the buy and sell data aligned with the clock times; and a buy and sell execution system having an input communicating with the decision logic for executing buy and sell orders in conformance with the buy/sell rules. In the securities trading system according to the invention, the decision logic includes at least one decision agent, the agent representing a respective buy/sell rule, wherein further the decision logic may include at least two decision agents, each decision agent representing a respective buy rule or a respective sell rule. Artificial intelligence is provided in that the decision agents are rewarded in a feed-back arrangement by being given added or reduced voting power when their recommendations are found to respectively result in successful or unsuccessful decisions. Thereby a self-learning feature is provided which results in improving the performance of the system as the number of transactions increase.",

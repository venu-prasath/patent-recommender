    "abstract": "Methods for providing a computer implemented medical diagnosis are provided. In one aspect, a method includes receiving an input from a user comprising at least one symptom of the user, and providing the at least one symptom as an input to a medical model. The method also includes deriving estimates of the probability of the user having a disease from the discriminative model, inputting the estimates to the inference engine, performing approximate inference on the probabilistic graphical model to obtain a prediction of the probability that the user has that disease, and outputting the probability of the user having the disease for display by a display device.",

    "title": "Document retrieval system",
    "abstract": "A document retrieval system employs a keyword connection table which contains relation information of keyword connections respectively coupling two arbitrary keywords which are used for retrieving registered documents. The relation information at least includes a relation name and a relationship describing the relation between the two arbitrary keywords. The relation information may dynamically change depending on a frequency of use of the keywords, that is, by a learning function.",

    "title": "System and method for enabling multi-element bidding for influencinga position on a search result list generated by a computer network search engine",
    "abstract": "A system and method for enabling information providers using a computer network such as the Internet to influence a position for a search listing within a search result list generated by an Internet search engine. A database stores accounts for the network information providers. Each account contains contact and billing information for a network information provider. In addition, each account contains at least one search listing having at least three components: a description, a search term comprising one or more keywords, and a bid amount. The network information provider may add, delete, or modify a search listing after authenticated login. A search term relevant to the content of the web site or other information source to be listed is first selected. A search listing includes the search term and a description. A bidding process occurs when the network information provider enters a new bid amount for a search listing. The system and method then compares the bid amount with all other bid amounts for the same search term, and generates a rank value for all search listings having that search term. The rank value determines where the listing will appear on the search results list page that is generated in response to a query of the search term by a searcher.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method of generating a search result list in response to a search request from a searcher, the method comprising:\nstoring a plurality of search listings, each search listing being associated with a bid amount and a search term, the bid amount including a market value corresponding to a money amount chargeable to an account of an advertiser associated with the search listing;\ndetermining the market values of the respective bids by determining a product of a bid received from a respective advertiser and a probability that one or more bid events will occur, the one or more bid events including a click-through, including\ncalculating a numerator as a ratio of an estimated number of times the one or more bid events will occur to an estimated number of times the one or more bid events could occur within a specified time period,\ncalculating a denominator representing the standard click-through rate for listings of the average ranking, over the same specified period of time, of the identified search listing corresponding to the bid, and\ncalculating the probability as the ratio of the numerator to the denominator;\nreceiving a search request from the searcher;\nidentifying search listings having search terms generating a match with the received search request;\nordering the identified search listings in a search result list according to values of the respective bid amounts of the identified search listings;\ndetecting a clickthrough by the searcher of one of the ordered search listings; and\nin response to the clickthrough, charging the account of the advertiser associated with the one search listing by the bid amount.\n2. A method of operating a pay for placement web site, the method comprising:\nmaintaining a database searchable by a search engine, the database including a plurality of search listings, each search listing being associated with an Internet website, a search term and a bid amount, the bid amount corresponding to a money amount chargeable to a web site promoter each time the web site promoter's web site is referred by the search engine;\nreceiving a search request from a searcher;\nidentifying search listings generating a match with the search request; and\nordering the identified search listings into a search result list in accordance with the values of the respective bid amounts for the identified search listings;\nreceiving none, one or more of the following:\na retrieval request from the searcher to retrieve information associated with a selected search listing in the search result list, and\none or more notifications that the searcher has performed one or more respective actions in connection with the selected search listing;\ndebiting the account of the web site promoter associated with the selected search listing and the respective bid as follows:\nby the bid element amount for impression,\nby the bid element amount for clickthrough, provided a clickthrough request was received, and\nby the bid element amounts for, respectively, one or more actions, provided notifications were received for said one or more actions.\n3. The method of claim 2 wherein the values of the respective bid amounts are calculated as the sum of:\nthe bid element amount for impression;\nthe value of the bid element amount for clickthrough; and\nthe respective values of the bid element amounts for actions.\n4. The method of claim 3 wherein the value of the bid element amount for clickthrough is calculated as a product of the bid element amount and the probability that the clickthrough event will occur.\n5. The method of claim 4 wherein the probability is calculated as a ratio of an estimated number of times the clickthrough events will occur to an estimated number of times the clickthrough events could occur within a specified time period.\n6. The method of claim 4 further comprising:\ncalculating a numerator as a ratio of an estimated number of times the clickthrough events will occur to an estimated number of times the clickthrough events could occur within a specified time period;\ncalculating a denominator representing the standard click-through rate for listings of the average ranking, over the same specified period of time, of the identified search listing corresponding to the bid; and\ncalculating the probability as the ratio of the numerator to the denominator.\n7. The method of claim 3 wherein the value of a bid element amount for an action is calculated as the product of the bid element amount and the probability that the action event will occur.\n8. The method of claim 7 wherein the probability is calculated as a ratio of an estimated number of times the action events will occur to an estimated number of times the action events could occur within a specified time period.\n9. The method of claim 7 further comprising:\ncalculating a numerator as a ratio of an estimated number of times the action events will occur to an estimated number of times the action events could occur within a specified time period;\ncalculating a denominator representing the standard click-through rate for listings of the average ranking, over the same specified period of time, of the identified search listing corresponding to the bid; and\ncalculating the probability as the ratio of the numerator to the denominator.\n10. A method of generating a search result list in response to a search request from a searcher, the method comprising:\nstoring a plurality of search listings, each search listing being associated with an Internet website, one or more search terms and one or more bid elements, each bid element amount corresponding to a money amount chargeable to a web site promoter each time the web site promoter's web site is referred by the search engine;\nreceiving a search request from a searcher;\nidentifying search listings generating a match with the search request; and\nordering the identified search listings into a search result list the order of which is influenced by the values of the respective bid amounts for the identified search listings;\nreceiving none, one or more of the following:\na retrieval request from the searcher to retrieve information associated with a selected search listing in the search result list, and\none or more notifications that the searcher has performed one or more respective actions in connection with the selected search listing;\ndebiting the account of the web site promoter associated with the selected search listing and the respective bid elements as follows:\nby the bid element amount for impression, provided the system allows for bidding by impression,\nby the bid element amount for clickthrough, provided the system allows for bidding by clickthrough, and provided a clickthrough request was received, and\nby the bid element amounts for, respectively, one or more actions, provided the system allows for bidding by action, and provided notifications were received for said one or more actions.\n11.

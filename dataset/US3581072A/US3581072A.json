    "abstract": "A special purpose digital computer matches orders and establishes market prices in an auction market for fungible goods. Priced orders to buy are arranged in descending order by price and priced orders to sell are arranged in ascending order by price within each price range, all orders are arranged in descending order by time of placement so that the older orders are uppermost. All compatibly priced orders are then matched starting with the highest priced order to buy and the lowest priced order to sell and proceeding sequentially until all compatibly priced pairs of orders have been matched. The prices accompanying the last pair of orders to be matched are then used to establish a trading price for all of the matched pairs and a new market price for future transactions. Unpriced or ''''at market'''' orders are assigned prices based upon the market price, unless the market price is substantially below the prices of all priced buy orders or substantially above the price of all priced sell orders, in which case the unpriced orders are not assigned prices until a new market price has been established.",

A machine implementable method for establishing market prices and for matching orders in an auction market that includes a data processor and a plurality of data input stations at which machine-readable orders to buy or to sell a plurality of differing types of fungible goods may be placed, said orders being either priced orders or at ''''at market'''' orders; said method comprising the steps of: collecting orders as they are placed in data storage areas of the data processor; using one or more storage areas of the data processor: to separate the orders relating to different types of fungible goods into separate groups; within each group, to separate the buy orders from the sell orders; within each group of buy orders or sell orders, to arrange the orders sequentially by price with the buy orders arranged in descending order by price and with the sell orders arranged in ascending order by price; and within each group of buy orders and sell orders, to arrange identically priced orders in descending order by time of placement so that the oldest orders are uppermost; sequentially matching all of the buy orders and all of the sell orders within each group that can be compatibly matched, starting by first matching the highest priced buy order to the lowest priced sell order, and by then proceeding sequentially through the remaining buy orders and sell orders at rates that maintain equality at all times between the quantity of goods represented by matched orders to sell, breaking individual orders into a plurality of parts as necessary to maintain this equality; checking the compatibility of each match by seeing that the price accompanying each buy order is greater than or equal to the price accompanying each sell order, using comparison means within the data processor; and adjusting the market price of the various goods to fall within the limits established by the prices accompanying the last pair of orders within each group that were compatibly matched.\n20. A method as in claim 19 and including the additional steps of comparing the prices of the orders within each group to the established market price of the goods before the orders are arranged and matched and withholding the ''''at market'''' orders within a group from arranging and from matching and price comparing until after a new market price is established, whenever all or most priced orders to buy within the group carry a price that is substantially above the market price or whenever all or most priced orders to sell within the group carry a price that is substantially below the market price, said ''''at market'''' orders being later matched to each other and to any remaining buy and sell orders that are compatible with the new market price.\n21. A machine implementable method of establishing upper and lower limits on the price of a given kind of fungible goods in an auction market where there is an established market price stored within a data processor and where both priced and unpriced machine-readable buy and sell orders are to be matched by the data processor, said method comprising the steps of: pairing orders to buy with orders to sell, starting with the order to buy having the highest price and with the order to sell having the lowest price, and continuing through the orders sequentially by price, taking unpriced orders at a price that is related to the established market price, using data retrieval means of the data processor to seek out and to pair the orders; sequentially comparing the prices accompanying the orders so paired using comparison means within the data processor, and locating the last pair of orders to be matched in which the order to buy is accompanied by a price that is higher than or equal to the price accompanying the order to sell; and determining the prices accompanying said last pair of orders and storing these prices within the data processor as new upper and lower limits on the established market price for the goods.\n22. A method as in claim 21 and further including the step of preventing unpriced orders from being paired whenever the market price is substantially below the prices of all or most priced buy orders or whenever the market price is substantially above the prices of all or most priced sell orders, using data processor comparison means and/or arithmetic means to make this determination.\n23. A method as in claim 22 in which the test of whether the market price is substantially below or above the prices of priced buy or sell orders is carried out by the data processor comparison means comparing the market price plus a margin number to the prices of all priced buy orders, and comparing the market price minus a margin number to the prices of all priced sell orders.",

    "title": "Hypertext document retrieval system and method",
    "abstract": "A search engine for retrieving documents pertinent to a query indexes documents in accordance with hyperlinks pointing to those documents. The indexer traverses the hypertext database and finds hypertext information including the address of the document the hyperlinks point to and the anchor text of each hyperlink. The information is stored in an inverted index file, which may also be used to calculate document link vectors for each hyperlink pointing to a particular document. When a query is entered, the search engine finds all document vectors for documents having the query terms in their anchor text. A query vector is also calculated, and the dot product of the query vector and each document link vector is calculated. The dot products relating to a particular document are summed to determine the relevance ranking for each document.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method of indexing documents, the method comprising:\nobtaining a list of hyperlinks pointing to each document, wherein each hyperlink includes one or more terms;\nindexing each document with the terms in the hyperlinks pointing to that document, wherein a number of hyperlinks, each containing a particular term, may point to a document; and\nindexing the number of hyperlinks containing the particular term pointing to the document with that document.\n2. The method of claim 1 wherein:\na particular term may appear in hyperlinks pointing to a number of documents; and\nthe number of documents having the particular term in hyperlinks pointing to those documents is indexed with that term.\n3. The method of claim 2 wherein the indexing comprises creating a file listing:\neach term;\nthe number of documents having that term in hyperlinks pointing to those documents;\na document identifier for each document having that term in hyperlinks pointing to that document; and\nthe number of hyperlinks containing that term pointing to each identified document.\n4. The method of claim 1 wherein:\na particular term may appear in hyperlinks pointing to a number of documents; and\nthe number of documents having the particular term in hyperlinks pointing to those documents is indexed with a document identifier for each document having the particular term in a hyperlink pointing to that document.\n5. The method of claim 4 wherein each document having a particular term in a hyperlink pointing to that document is indexed with an inverse of the number of documents having the particular term in hyperlinks pointing to those documents.\n6. The method of claim 1 wherein:\na term may appear a number of times in a hyperlink pointing to a document; and\nthe number of times each term appears in a hyperlink is indexed with the document pointed to by the hyperlink.\n7. The method of claim 1 wherein the terms are stemmed words.\n8. An apparatus comprising means for performing the method of claim 1.\n9. A computer-readable memory device comprising a set of instructions for performing the method of claim 1.\n10. A method of ranking documents based on the document's relevance to a query, wherein the query comprises at least one term, and wherein hyperlinks contain terms and point to corresponding documents, the method comprising:\ncomparing the words in the query to the words in a hyperlink to obtain a relevance ranking for each hyperlink; and\nsumming the relevance rankings for each hyperlink pointing to a particular document to obtain a summed relevance score for that document.\n11. The method of claim 10 wherein:\na number of hyperlinks, each containing a particular term, may point to a document; and\nthe number of hyperlinks containing the particular term pointing to the document is indexed with that document.\n12. The method of claim 11 wherein:\na particular term may appear in hyperlinks pointing to a number of documents; and\nthe number of documents having a particular term in hyperlinks pointing to those documents is indexed with that term.\n13. The method of claim 12 comprising the creation of a list wherein the list indexes:\neach term;\nthe number of documents having hyperlinks pointing to those documents;\na document identifier for each document; and\nthe number of hyperlinks containing that term pointing to each document.\n14. The method of claim 10 wherein:\na particular term may appear in hyperlinks pointing to a number of documents; and\nthe number of documents having the particular term in hyperlinks pointing to those documents is indexed with a document identifier for each document having the particular term in a hyperlink pointing to that document.\n15. The method of claim 14 wherein each document having a particular term in a hyperlink pointing to that document is indexed with an inverse of the number of documents having the particular term in hyperlinks pointing to those documents.\n16. The method of claim 10 wherein:\na term may appear a number of times in a hyperlink pointing to a document; and\nthe number of times each term appears in a hyperlink is indexed with the document pointed to by the hyperlink.\n17. The method of claim 10 wherein the terms are stemmed words.\n18. The method of claim 10 wherein:\nthe query is represented by a query vector wherein the query vector contains a dimension for each term in the query; and\neach document is represented by document link vectors for each hyperlink pointing to the document, wherein each document link vector contains a dimension for each term in the corresponding hyperlink pointing to that document.\n19. The method of claim 18 wherein comparing the words in the query to the words in the hyperlink comprises calculating the dot product of the query vector with the document link vector for that hyperlink.\n20. The method of claim 19 wherein summing the relevance ranking for each hyperlink pointing to a document comprises summing the dot products obtained using the document link vectors for a particular document to obtain the summed relevance score for that document.\n21. The method of claim 20 wherein the summed relevance scores for each document are compared to obtain a ranking of documents.\n22. The method of claim 18 wherein the dimension for a term in a query vector is related to the inverse of the number of documents having a respective hyperlink containing that term pointing to those documents.\n23. The method of claim 18 wherein the dimension for a term in a document link vector is related to the inverse of the number of documents having a respective hyperlink containing that term pointing to those documents.\n24. An apparatus comprising means for performing the method of claim 10.\n25. A computer-readable memory device comprising a set of instructions for performing the method of claim 10.",

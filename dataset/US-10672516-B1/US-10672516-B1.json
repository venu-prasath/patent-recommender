    "abstract": "Systems, methods, and computer-readable media are provided for facilitating clinical decision making by directing the emission of computer-generated health-care related recommendations towards contexts in which the recipient will likely find the recommendations salient and will likely welcome them and act upon them. \u2018Uptake\u2019 of computer-generated recommendations for diagnostic tests or therapeutic interventions is thereby substantially increased, and \u2018alert fatigue\u2019 is substantially decreased. Embodiments of our technology overcome certain drawbacks associated with the prior art by providing a means for ascertaining which decision-support recommendations are likely to be favorably considered by the recipient and acted-upon (recommendation \u2018uptake\u2019). System and method embodiments for providing a predicted probability of user uptake of a context-specific system-generated recommendation patient are disclosed herein and for applying that information to decide whether or not to emit the relevant recommendation.",
    "claims": "\n1. A non-transitory computer-readable media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon that when executed provide a method for providing recommendations to a provider based on transaction data for a plurality of patients, the method comprising:\ngenerating a candidate association rule;\ncomparing the generated candidate association rules against existing association rules, the comparing comprising:\ncomparing a confidence value of the generated candidate association rules against a confidence value of the existing association rules; and\ncomparing a conviction value of the generated candidate association rules against a conviction value of the existing association rules;\nwhen the comparing the generated candidate association rules against existing association rules exceeds a threshold, updating an existing association rulebase with the generated candidate association rule;\ndetermining a patient context comprising serial medical data;\naccumulating an ensemble of recommendation information;\nidentifying a pattern that is predictive of recommendation acceptance over said ensemble and according to the generated candidate association rule; and\ndetermining to refrain from emitting a recommendation based on said pattern, the determining to refrain from emitting a recommendation comprising filtering the ensemble based on the pattern that is predictive of recommendation acceptance.\n2. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 1, wherein the assembling of transaction data comprises retrieval of structured discrete data elements that are represented by coded concepts within a data dictionary or an ontology.\n3. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 1, wherein the step of assembling transaction data comprises retrieval of codification items from unstructured textual documents using a search facility and natural language processing algorithm.\n4. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage devices of claim 1, further comprising processing said pattern based on likelihood of predictive power.\n5. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 4, wherein said step of processing comprises using statistical lift to determine whether or not to retain a candidate association rule within an association rulebase store.\n6. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 4, wherein said step of processing comprises using statistical conviction to determine whether or not to retain a candidate association rule within an association rulebase store.\n7. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 4, wherein said step of processing comprises using statistical confidence to determine whether or not to retain a candidate association rule within an association rulebase store.\n8. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 6, further comprising evaluating a metric based at least in part on old statistical confidence and a new statistical confidence.\n9. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 7, further comprising evaluating a metric based at least in part on an old statistical conviction and a new statistical conviction.\n10. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 4, wherein said pattern comprises a multiple variable feature pattern.\n11. A non-transitory computer-readable media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon that when executed provide a method for providing a decision support recommendation service, the method comprising:\naccumulating medical transaction data associated with a user including patient data for past events;\naccumulating operational data indicating recommendations previously presented to a user and an action of the user associated with the recommendation;\ndetermining a frequent itemset associating a recommendation and a user acceptance of said recommendation based on said action of a user;\ngenerating a set of association rules for generating recommendations based on said operational data, said medical transaction data and said frequent itemset;\ndetermining that a confidence value of the generated set of association rules and a conviction value of the generated set of association rules exceed a threshold;\nprocessing the set of association rules for likelihood of predictive power;\nreceiving an event and a recommendation context;\nidentifying a plurality of candidate recommendations predicted by the association rules to match the recommendation context; and\ndetermining to refrain from issuing a qualifying candidate recommendation based on the likelihood of predictive power with regard to predicting recommendation uptake.\n12. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 11, wherein said medical transaction data comprises at least one of: patient care operation type, patient type, patient age, patient history, institution type, venue, caregiver type, and primary payor identity.\n13. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 11, wherein said action of the user comprises at least one of: the user selecting a control in a graphical user interface, the user waiting at least a first predetermined period of time after a recommendation is presented before dismissing the recommendation, the user waiting at least a second predetermined period of time after a recommendation is presented before selecting a control in a graphical user interface, the user providing input indicative that a recommendation was considered, and the user providing input indicative that a recommendation was not considered.\n14. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 11, further comprising processing said set of association rules for relevance.\n15. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 14, wherein processing said set of association rules for relevance comprises applying a set of screening rules.\n16. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 11, further comprising ranking the plurality of candidate recommendations using a score of each candidate association rule to identify at least a highest ranking candidate association rule.\n17. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 11, further comprising generating a recommendation message by using at least one attribute from each candidate association rule to select a recommendation message for that candidate association rule from a repository of recommendation messages.\n18. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 11, wherein said step of processing the set of association rules comprises using statistical lift to determine whether or not to retain a candidate association rule within an association rulebase store.\n19. The non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 11, wherein said step of processing the set of association rules comprises using statistical confidence to determine whether or not to retain a candidate association rule within an association rulebase store.\n20. A method for providing recommendations to a provider based on transaction data for a plurality of patients, the method comprising:\ngenerating a candidate association rule;\ncomparing the generated candidate association rules against existing association rules, the comparing comprising:\ncomparing a confidence value of the generated candidate association rules against a confidence value of the existing association rules; and\ncomparing a conviction value of the generated candidate association rules against a conviction value of the existing association rules;\nwhen the comparing the generated candidate association rules against existing association rules exceeds a threshold, updating an existing association rulebase with the generated candidate association rule;\ndetermining a patient context comprising serial medical data;\naccumulating an ensemble of recommendation information;\nidentifying a pattern that is predictive of recommendation acceptance over said ensemble and according to the generated candidate association rule; and\ndetermining to refrain from emitting a recommendation based on said pattern, the determining to refrain from emitting a recommendation comprising filtering the ensemble based on the pattern that is predictive of recommendation acceptance."

    "abstract": "Embodiments are directed towards the visualization of machine data received from computing clusters. Embodiments may enable improved analysis of computing cluster performance, error detection, troubleshooting, error prediction, or the like. Individual cluster nodes may generate machine data that includes information and data regarding the operation and status of the cluster node. The machine data is received from each cluster node for indexing by one or more indexing applications. The indexed machine data including the complete data set may be stored in one or more index stores. A visualization application enables a user to select one or more analysis lenses that may be used to generate visualizations of the machine data. The visualization application employs the analysis lens to produce visualizations of the computing cluster machine data.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method comprising:\nreceiving, by a computer system, machine data from one or more data sources;\nanalyzing, by the computer system, the machine data to identify a number of occurrences of a particular error condition in the machine data;\nidentifying, by the computer system, a first event pattern based upon the identification of the number of occurrences of the particular error condition;\nregistering, by the computer system, the first event pattern in response to identifying the first event pattern, to produce a registered event pattern;\ngenerating, by the computer system, a visualization representing one or more information technology systems that generated machine data associated with a second event pattern, based upon a determination that the second event pattern is the same as or similar to the registered event pattern;\ngenerating, by the computer system, a control tool within the visualization, wherein user interaction with the control tool triggers:\nretrieving events by searching for events surrounding the second event pattern; and replaying the retrieved events; and\ngenerating within the visualization a representation of the replaying of the retrieved events surrounding the second event pattern, wherein the control tool controls a time window for replaying the retrieved events;\npredicting a future occurrence of the registered event pattern or an event pattern similar to the registered event pattern based on an analysis of the registered event pattern; and\ndistributing an alert notification of the predicted future occurrence to one or more users.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein the registered event pattern is specified by a user.\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein the analyzing the machine data uses scripts to analyze occurrences of the particular error condition.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein the analyzing the machine data uses regular expressions to analyze occurrences of the particular error condition.\n5. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nparsing the machine data to determine event boundaries within the machine data to generate a plurality of time stamped events.\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine data includes log files.\n7. The method of claim 1, wherein the registered event pattern is represented in a heat map, and wherein the heat map indicates a metric for each data source of the one or more data sources.\n8. The method of claim 1, wherein the alert notification includes any of: an email, a text message, an audio user-interface alarm, or a visual user-interface alarm.\n9. One or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media, storing one or more sequences of instructions, execution of which by one or more processors causes performance of:\nreceiving machine data from one or more data sources;\nanalyzing the machine data to identify a number of occurrences of a particular error condition in the machine data;\nidentifying a first event pattern based upon the identification of the number of occurrences of the particular error condition;\nregistering the first event pattern in response to identifying the first event pattern, to produce a registered event pattern;\ngenerating a visualization representing one or more information technology systems that generated machine data associated with a second event pattern, based upon a determination that the second event pattern is the same as or similar to the registered event pattern;\ngenerating a control tool within the visualization, wherein user interaction with the control tool triggers:\nretrieving events by searching for events surrounding the second event pattern; and replaying the retrieved events; and\ngenerating within the visualization a representation of the replaying of the retrieved events surrounding the second event pattern, wherein the control tool controls a time window for replaying the retrieved events;\npredicting, by the computer system, a future occurrence of the registered event pattern or an event pattern similar to the registered event pattern based on an analysis of the registered event pattern; and\ndistributing, by the computer system, an alert notification of the predicted future occurrence to one or more users.\n10. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage claim 9, wherein the machine data includes log files.\n11. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage claim 9, wherein the alert notification includes any of: an email, a text message, an audio user-interface alarm, or a visual user-interface alarm.\n12. An apparatus comprising:\none or more processors; and\na memory storing instructions, execution of which by the one or more processors, causes the one or more processors to:\nreceiving machine data from one or more data sources;\nanalyzing the machine data to identify a number of occurrences of a particular error condition in the machine data;\nidentifying a first event pattern based upon the identification of the number of occurrences of the particular error condition;\nregistering the first event pattern in response to identifying the first event pattern, to produce a registered event pattern;\ngenerating a visualization representing one or more information technology systems that generated machine data associated with a second event pattern, based upon a determination that the second event pattern is the same as or similar to the registered event pattern;\ngenerating a control tool within the visualization, wherein user interaction with the control tool triggers:\nretrieving events by searching for events surrounding the second event pattern; and replaying the retrieved events; and\ngenerating within the visualization a representation of the replaying of the retrieved events surrounding the second event pattern, wherein the control tool controls a time window for replaying the retrieved events;\npredicting a future occurrence of the registered event pattern or an event pattern similar to the registered event pattern based on an analysis of the registered event pattern; and\ndistributing an alert notification of the predicted future occurrence to one or more users.\n13. The apparatus of claim 12, wherein the machine data includes log files.\n14. The apparatus of claim 12, wherein the alert notification includes any of: an email, a text message, an audio user-interface alarm, or a visual user-interface alarm."

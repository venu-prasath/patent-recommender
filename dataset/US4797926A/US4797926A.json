    "title": "Digital speech vocoder",
    "abstract": "A speech analyzer and synthesizer system using sinusoidal encoding and decoding techniques for voiced frames and noise excitation or multiple pulse excitation for unvoiced frames. For voiced frames, the analyzer transmits the pitch, values for each harmonic frequency by defining the offset from integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, total frame energy, and linear predictive coding, LPC, coefficients. The synthesizer is responsive to that information to determine the phase of the fundamental frequency and each harmonic based on the transmitted pitch and harmonic offset information and to determine the amplitudes of the harmonics utilizing the total frame energy and LPC coefficients. Once the phase and amplitudes have been determined for the fundamental and harmonic frequencies, the sinusoidal analysis is performed for voiced frames. For each frame, the determined frequencies and amplitudes are defined at the center of the frame, and a linear interpolation is used both to determine continuous frequency and amplitude signals of the fundamental and the harmonics throughout the entire frame by the synthesizer. In addition, the analyzer initially adjusts the pitch so that the harmonics are evenly distributed around integer multiples of this pitch.",

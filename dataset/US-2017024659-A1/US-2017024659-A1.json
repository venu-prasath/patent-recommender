    "abstract": "A system and method for improved data searching by generalizing/learning relational concepts and reducing the number and complexity of examples required to perform an example or concept based search. The system and the method providing ways for a user to generate relevant search parameters or features, that is, examples or concepts, with a non-query language or, alternatively, without coding, and thus, without necessitating expert knowledge of coding language.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method for generalizing/learning relationship concepts of a hypotheses data structure from a very few positive examples comprising the steps of:\n(a) receiving a query request in a non-query language from a user for specific information;\n(b) generating a closed assumption hypotheses space having a plurality of hypotheses;\n(c) applying a Bayesian based scoring rule, being based on statistical and database completeness assumptions which focuses on the destructive commodities of examples, on the plurality of hypotheses;\n(d) performing at least one method for organizing, prioritizing and searching an expressive language of commonality hypotheses regarding the plurality of hypotheses; and\n(e) providing a result to the user in a non-query language.\n2. A method for example based searches of a hypotheses data structure in a data system, comprising the steps of:\n(a) generating a closed assumption hypotheses space (h-space), including the steps of:\n(a1) selecting initial parent hypotheses from the hypotheses data structure according to a predetermined criteria wherein the selected initial parent hypotheses have non-zero prior probabilities of at least one of correctness and relevance,\n(a2) adding each selected initial parent hypotheses to a hypotheses lattice, and\n(a3) generating and adding at least one child hypotheses to the lattice in which at least one child hypothesis is generated from a parent hypothesis of the lattice by specialization operators, and\n(b) upon receiving a query example to be searched, selecting and providing at least one response to the query example consisting of at least one candidate hypothesis, comprising the steps of:\n(b1) selecting the at least one candidate from the lattice as representing a potential solution of the query by comparing the query example with the at least one candidate hypothesis selected from the lattice;\n(b2) scoring the at least one candidate hypothesis selected from the lattice according to a criteria of relevance to the query example;\n(b3) generating a corresponding solution likelihood value for the at least one candidate hypothesis, with the solution likelihood value representing a probability that the at least one corresponding hypothesis is a valid solution to the query example, and\n(b4) selecting and outputting at least one response to the query example comprising at least one candidate hypothesis selected from the lattice having a likelihood value greater than a predetermined lower limit.\n3. The method for example based searches of the hypotheses data structure in the data system according to claim 2, wherein:\neach of the parent hypotheses and child hypotheses from the hypotheses data structure is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon which comprises at least one of a statement of a fact or a relationship;\neach of the hypotheses contains at least one hypothesis element; and\nthe at least one hypothesis element comprises at least one of:\na fact, a literal, a relationship, an identification, an event, an action or an information item related to and defining the hypothesis.\n4. The method for example based searches of the hypotheses data structure in the data system according to claim 2, wherein:\nthe selection of initial parent hypotheses is based upon a heuristic selection criteria including at least one of:\ncomplexity, relevance, and formedness;\nwherein complexity is determined by a number of variables in a definition of an initial hypothesis,\nrelevance is an existence of at least one relationship between the query example and the at least one candidate hypothesis under consideration, and\nformedness is a degree of similarity between the initial parent hypothesis under consideration and a second initial parent hypothesis of lesser complexity.\n5. The method for example based searches of the hypotheses data structure in the data system according to claim 2, wherein:\nthe specialization operators generating child hypotheses include at least one of the addition of:\nat least one literal to at least one parent hypothesis,\nthe narrowing of at least one literal relationship by replacing a predicate of at least one literal with an immediate sub-relation predicate,\nthe collapse of at least one variable by replacing all instances of the at least one variable with another variable, and\nthe instantiating of at least one variable by replacing the at least one variable with a constant.\n6. The method for example based searches of the hypotheses data structure in the data system according to claim 2, wherein the step of adding each selected initial parent hypotheses to the hypotheses lattice comprises:\nadding at least one initial parent hypothesis to a corresponding lattice arc of the lattice, and\nthe step of adding at least one child hypothesis to the lattice comprises adding the at least one child hypothesis to a sub-lattice arc corresponding to the lattice arc corresponding to the parent hypothesis from which the child hypothesis was generated.\n7. The method for example based searches of the hypotheses data structure in the data system according to claim 2, wherein the step of adding at least one child hypothesis to the lattice further includes the step of:\nadding at least one next generation child hypothesis to the lattice by:\nselecting a child hypothesis to be a successor hypothesis to be operated upon by at least specialization operator,\noperating upon the successor hypothesis with at least one specialization operation to generate at least one next generation child hypothesis, and\nadding each next generation child hypothesis to a lattice arc of the successor hypothesis.\n8. The method for example based searches of the hypotheses data structure in the data system according to claim 2, wherein the step of selecting a child hypothesis to be a successor hypothesis includes:\n(1) determining a promise value for a child hypothesis in which a promise value is a function of at least one of:\nan example coverage value representing a degree to which the child hypothesis matches the query example,\na hypothesis relevance value representing a degree to which the child example relates to the query example, and\na simplicity value representing the number of literals and variables defining the child hypothesis, and\n(2) selecting for use as successor hypotheses the child hypotheses which have a promise value greater than a predetermined value.\n9. The method for example based searches of the hypotheses data structure in the data system according to claim 2, wherein the step of generating and adding at least one child hypotheses to the lattice further comprises the step of:\neliminating non-relevant hypotheses from the lattice.\n10. The method for example based searches of the hypotheses data structure in the data system according to claim 9, wherein hypotheses are selected for elimination from the lattice according to a criteria including at least one of:\nbeing overly inclusive, being overly exclusive, being redundant with regard to other hypotheses, membership of a class of hypothesis, complexity, formedness or relevance to potential query examples.\n11. The method for example based searches of the hypotheses data structure in the data system according to claim 10, wherein:\nthe elimination of non-relevant hypotheses from the lattice is performed during at least one of:\nthe addition of hypotheses and child hypotheses to the lattice, and\nafter generation of the hypotheses space.\n12. The method for example based searches of the hypotheses data structure in the data system according to claim 2, wherein:\ncandidate hypotheses potentially representing a solution to the query example are selected from the lattice for scoring by at least one of:\nselection of successive hypotheses from the lattice,\ndetermination of relevance of a hypotheses to the query example, and\nselection of candidate hypotheses by comparison between elements of the query example and elements of the hypotheses.\n13. The method for example based searches of the hypotheses data structure in the data system according to claim 2, wherein:\nscoring the candidate hypotheses by the steps of:\ndetermining a degree of relevance of all hypotheses elements of each candidate hypothesis that matches at least one hypotheses element of the query example, and\ngenerating for each candidate hypothesis a solution likelihood value representing the probability that the candidate hypotheses is a valid solution to the query example.\n14. The method for example based searches of the hypotheses data structure in the data system according to claim 2, wherein the selection of at least one candidate hypothesis as a potential solution to the query example comprises the steps of:\ncomparing and ranking the candidate hypotheses having a solution likelihood value greater than a predetermined lower limit, and\nselecting at least the candidate hypothesis having the greatest solution likelihood value as a solution to the query example.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present disclosure is to provide an Internet of Things (IoT) based method and system for interacting with users. The intelligent customer service system collects and stores real-time status information of at least one device in an IoT; receives a request of a user; queries a device knowledge graph according to content of the request, and invoke the real-time status information of a related IoT device to acquire a corresponding request result, wherein the device knowledge graph is established according to usage information and/or maintenance information of one or more IoT devices; and return the request result to the user. Compared with the prior art, the present disclosure enables the user to acquire a better customer service experience.",
    "claims": "\n1. An Internet of Things (IoT) based method for interacting with users, the method comprising:\ncollecting and storing real-time status information of at least one device in an IoT;\nwherein, the method further comprises:\nreceiving a request of a user;\nquerying a device knowledge graph according to content of the request, and invoking the real-time status information of a related IoT device to acquire a corresponding request result, wherein the device knowledge graph is established according to usage information and/or maintenance information of one or more IoT devices; and\nreturning the request result to the user.\n2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the method further comprises:\nquerying the device knowledge graph to detect whether the IoT device is in an abnormal status, and performing a fault location when the IoT device is in an abnormal status, when the real-time status information of the at least one IoT device is collected; and\nnotifying a user of an abnormal device of a located problem.\n3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the method further comprises:\nquerying the device knowledge graph according to the real-time status information of the at least one IoT device to acquire best status information of the IoT device; and\nsending related prompt information to a user belonging to the IoT device based on the best status information.\n4. The method according to claim 3, wherein the prompt information comprises service recommended information.\n5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the acquiring a request result specifically comprises:\ntransferring the request to an external service to acquire an initial request result; and\nquerying the device knowledge graph according to the initial request result, and invoking the real-time status information of the related IoT device to acquire a final request result.\n6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the external service comprises a map service and the initial request result comprises navigation information.\n7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the method further comprises:\nintroducing a manual service, if querying the device knowledge graph fails to acquire the corresponding request result;\nrecording voice content of the manual service to extract a processing result; and\nupdating the device knowledge graph according to the content of the request and the processing result.\n8. The method according to claim 1, wherein the request of the user comprises a voice request;\nwherein, the receiving a request of a user specifically comprises:\nreceiving the voice request of the user; and\nperforming a voice recognition and a semantic analysis on the voice request to determine the content of the request of the user.\n9. An Internet of Things (IoT) based system for interacting with users, the system comprising:\nat least one processor; and\na memory storing instructions, which when executed by the at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to perform operations, the operations comprising:\ncollecting and storing real-time status information of at least one device in an IoT;\nwherein, the operations further comprises:\nreceiving a request of a user;\nquerying a device knowledge graph according to content of the request, and invoking the real-time status information of a related IoT device to acquire a corresponding request result, wherein the device knowledge graph is established according to usage information and/or maintenance information of one or more IoT devices; and\nreturning the request result to the user.\n10. The system according to claim 9, wherein the operations further comprises:\nquerying the device knowledge graph to detect whether the IoT device is in an abnormal status, and performing a fault location when the IoT device is in an abnormal status, when the real-time status information of the at least one IoT device is collected; and\nnotifying a user of an abnormal device of a located problem.\n11. The system according to claim 9, wherein the operations further comprises:\nquerying the device knowledge graph according to the real-time status information of the at least one IoT device to acquire best status information of the IoT device; and\nsending related prompt information to a user belonging to the IoT device based on the best status information.\n12. The system according to claim 11, wherein the prompt information comprises service recommended information.\n13. The system according to claim 9, wherein the acquiring a request result specifically comprises:\ntransferring the request to an external service to acquire an initial request result; and\nquerying the device knowledge graph according to the initial request result, and invoke the real-time status information of the related IoT device to acquire a final request result.\n14. The system according to claim 13, wherein the external service comprises a map service and the initial request result comprises navigation information.\n15. The system according to claim 9, wherein the operations further comprises:\nintroducing a manual service, if querying the device knowledge graph fails to acquire the corresponding request result;\nextracting related knowledge points of a processing this time from recorded conversation content of the manual service; and\nupdating the device knowledge graph based on the extracted knowledge points.\n16. The system according to claim 9, wherein the request of the user comprises a voice request;\nwherein, the receiving a request of a user specifically comprises:\nreceiving the voice request of the user; and\nperforming a voice recognition and a semantic analysis on the voice request to determine the content of the request of the user.\n17. A non-transitory computer storage medium storing a computer program, which when executed by one or more processors, causes the one or more processors to perform operations, the operations comprising:\ncollecting and storing real-time status information of at least one device in an IoT;\nreceiving a request of a user;\nquerying a device knowledge graph according to content of the request, and invoking the real-time status information of a related IoT device to acquire a corresponding request result, wherein the device knowledge graph is established according to usage information and/or maintenance information of one or more IoT devices; and\nreturning the request result to the user.",

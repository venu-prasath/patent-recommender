    "title": "Method of imaging the blood flow in a vascular tree",
    "abstract": "The invention relates to a method of imaging a vascular tree that yields additional information concerning the vascular tree. To this end, a sequence of clusters is determined from spatially coherent voxels in the three-dimensional image of the vascular tree, the sequence of said clusters corresponding to the flow direction of the blood or the contrast medium in said vascular tree.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method of imaging the blood flow in a vascular tree of an object (3) to be examined, which method comprising the steps of:\n2. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the clusters (C1, C2, C3, . . . ) are displayed on a display unit in such a manner that the sequence of clusters determined can be recognized.\n3. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein prior to the determination of the clusters, the three-dimensional image is segmented in such a manner that essentially only the vascular system is reproduced in the image.\n4. A method of imaging the blood flow-in a vascular tree of an object to be examined, which method includes the steps of:\n5. A method as claimed in claim 4, in which the times of arrival of the sequence of clusters determined are subjected to median filtering for the purpose of modification.\n6. A method as claimed in claim 4, in which in the case of an overlapping projection of clusters in the X-ray projection images and multiple arrival of the contrast medium bolus in this projection, the times of arrival are assigned to the associated clusters in the three-dimensional image in dependence on the times of arrival determined each time for the respective neighboring clusters in the vascular tree.\n7. A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein speed information is derived from the times of arrival determined for the clusters of the vascular tree.\n8. A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein at least one series of X-ray projection images that reproduces the vascular system in different phases of a contrast medium inflow is formed from a fixed projection direction.\n9. A method as claimed in claim 8, wherein that the series of X-ray projection images is formed from a projection direction for which the surface area covered by the vascular tree has a maximum value.\n10. A n X-ray device comprising:\n11. An X-ray device as claimed in claim 10, wherein the imaging unit includes a first X-ray source (12) and a first X-ray detector (13) for acquiring a series of two-dimensional X-ray images from a first projection direction, and a second X-ray source (12\u2032) and a second X-ray detector (13\u2032) for the simultaneous acquisition of a series of two-dimensional X-ray images from a second projection direction that encloses an angle of preferably 90\u00b0 relative to the first projection direction.\n12. An X-ray device comprising:\n13. A method of imaging blood flow in a vascular tree, the method comprising:\n14. The method as set forth in claim 13, wherein the assigning of a time of arrival includes:",

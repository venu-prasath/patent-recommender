    "title": "Videotelephone apparatus for transmitting high and low resolution video signals over telephone exchange lines",
    "abstract": "In an audiovisual communication, a first high fram rate video signal is derived from a motion image and converted to a low fram rate low resolution multiframe signal. A second high frame rate video signal is derived from an still image and converted to a single frame high resolution signal. Because of the low frame rates, the frequencies of the low and high resolution signals are within the range of frequencies of a telephone exchange line. A switching matrix is provided to sequentially couple both the low and high resolution signals to a transmission line in response to a mode select signal. The single frame high resolution signal is stored into a memory at the receiving end and repeatedly retrieved out of the memory into a display through the switching matrix.",

    "title": "Graphical user interface for navigating between street, hallway, room, and function metaphors",
    "abstract": "A graphical navigation user interface for enabling user control of a computer system may incorporate navigation levels. Each navigation level is based on a physical real-word metaphor. The navigation system includes a three four levels: a individual object level, a room level, a building level, a town level. An individual object level is the lowest navigation level and corresponds to specific function. The room level provides a user with options of specific functions. The building level includes a hallway metaphor where the user has options of choosing room objects through a doorway. The town level provides the user with options of choosing various building objects connect by a street metaphor.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for navigating within a graphical user interface of a computer system having a central processing unit coupled to a display device, the method comprising the steps of:\nproviding a hallway navigation level and a room navigation level;\ndisplaying on the display device, when the hallway navigation level is accessed, the hallway level navigation scene using a physical metaphor of a hallway of a building, the physical metaphor of the hallway including a metaphor for an entrance, the entrance providing access to the room navigation level;\ndisplaying on the display device, when the room navigation level is accessed, a room level navigation scene using a physical metaphor of a room, the room including physical metaphors corresponding to the plurality of function level functions, the room providing a superview for the plurality of function level functions;\naccessing a lower navigation level from the hallway navigation level by actuating the entrance; and\naccessing the room navigation level from a function navigation level by stepping back from the function navigation level.\n2. The method of claim 1 further comprising:\naccessing the hallway navigation level from the room navigation level by stepping back from the room navigation level.\n3. The method of claim 1 further comprising:\nproviding a function navigation level, the function navigation level including a plurality of functions;\ndisplaying on the display device, when the function navigation level is accessed, a function level navigation scene, the function level navigation scene including a functional metaphor representing one of the plurality of functions; and\naccessing a function level function from the room navigation level by actuating a corresponding physical metaphor of the first level function.\n4. The method of claim 1 wherein:\nthe stepping back is provided by accessing a step back function, the step back function being presented on the display device external to a displayed navigation scene.\n5. The method of claim 1 wherein:\nthe room navigation level is extensible by adding metaphors of additional entrances to the hallway level navigation scene.\n6. The method of claim 1 wherein:\nthe hallway is lengthened to include the additional entrances.\n7. The method of claim 6 wherein:\nwhen the hallway is lengthened so that the hallway is not entirely visible on the display device, the hallway that is not visible is accessed by actuating an arrow indicating a direction of movement down the hallway.\n8. An information handling apparatus comprising:\na central processing unit;\na display device coupled to the central processing unit;\nmeans for displaying a graphical user interface on the display device;\nmeans for providing the graphical user interface with a hallway navigation level and a room navigation level;\nmeans for displaying on the display device, when the hallway navigation level is accessed, the hallway level navigation scene using a physical metaphor of a hallway of a building, the physical metaphor of the hallway including a metaphor for an entrance, the entrance providing access to the room navigation level;\nmeans for displaying on the display device, when the room navigation level is accessed, a room level navigation scene using a physical metaphor of a room, the room including physical metaphors corresponding to the plurality of function level functions, the room providing a superview for the plurality of function level functions;\nmeans for accessing a lower navigation level from the hallway navigation level by actuating the entrance; and\nmeans for accessing the room navigation level from a function navigation level by stepping back from the function navigation level.\n9. The information handling apparatus of claim 8 further comprising:\nmeans for accessing the hallway navigation level from the room navigation level by stepping back from the room navigation level.\n10. The information handling apparatus of claim 9 further comprising:\nmeans for providing a function navigation level, the function navigation level including a plurality of functions;\nmeans for displaying on the display device, when the function navigation level is accessed, a function level navigation scene, the function level navigation scene including a functional metaphor representing one of the plurality of functions; and\nmeans for accessing a function level function from the room navigation level by actuating a corresponding physical metaphor of the first level function.\n11. The information handling apparatus of claim 9 wherein:\nthe stepping back is provided by accessing a step back function, the step back function being presented on the display device external to a displayed navigation scene.\n12. The information handling apparatus of claim 9 wherein:\nthe room navigation level is extensible by adding metaphors of additional entrances to the hallway level navigation scene.\n13. The information handling apparatus of claim 12 wherein:\nthe hallway is lengthened to include the additional entrances.\n14. The information handling apparatus of claim 13 wherein:\nwhen the hallway is lengthened so that the hallway is not entirely visible on the display device, the hallway that is not visible is accessed by actuating an arrow indicating a direction of movement down the hallway.",

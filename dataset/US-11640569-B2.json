    "abstract": "Systems and methods are described herein for learning an entity's trust model and risk tolerance. An entity's trust score may be calculated based on data from a variety of data sources, and this data may be combined according to a set of weights which reflect an entity's trust model and risk tolerance. For example, an entity may weight data of a certain type more heavily for certain types of transactions and another type of data more heavily for other transactions. By gathering data about the entity, a system may predict the entity's trust model and risk tolerance and adjust the set of weights accordingly for calculating trust scores. Furthermore, by monitoring how entities adjust weights for different transaction types, default weighting profiles may be created that are customized for specific transaction types. As another example, an entity's trust score, as reported to a requesting entity, may be adjusted based on that requesting entity's own trust model, or how \u201ctrusting\u201d the requesting entity is.",
    "claims": "\n1. A system for adjusting, for a requesting entity, a trust score for a second entity, the system comprising:\na user device of a requesting entity comprising a processor and a display, the user device configured to receive a baseline trust score of a second entity from a server, wherein the baseline trust score for the second entity was determined at a remote location using processing circuitry;\nthe user device further configured to receive an indication from the requesting entity and, in response to receiving the indication, send a request to the server for an adjusted trust score for the second entity; and\nthe user device further configured to receive from the server, an indication of the adjusted trust score, wherein the adjusted trust score for the second entity was determined at a remote location using processing circuitry configured to:\nreceive data about the requesting entity from a first remote source, wherein the received data comprises text data about the requesting entity;\nretrieve, from a database, a file indicating one or more trusting keywords;\ncompare the text data to the one or more trusting keywords to determine whether the text data contains the one or more trusting keywords;\nin response to determining that the text data contains the one or more trusting keywords, calculate a trusting adjustment score for the requesting entity based on the received data from the first remote source; and\ndetermine an adjusted trust score for the second entity by combining the trusting adjustment score and the baseline trust score for the second entity.\n2. The system of claim 1 wherein the processing circuitry is configured to combine the trusting adjustment score and the baseline trust score for the second entity by multiplying the baseline trust score for the second entity by the trusting adjustment score.\n3. The system of claim 1 wherein the processing circuitry is configured to combine the trusting adjustment score and the baseline trust score for the second entity by combining the baseline trust score for the second entity and the trusting adjustment score according to a weighted sum.\n4. The system of claim 3 wherein the weighted sum is based on a user-assigned weight.\n5. The system of claim 1 wherein the received data further comprises a user indication of how trusting the user believes the requesting entity to be, wherein the user is associated with a third entity that is different from the requesting entity.\n6. The system of claim 1, the user device further configured to:\nreceive and store the trusting adjustment score for the requesting entity; and\nuse the stored trusting adjustment score to determine an adjusted trust score for a third entity by combining the stored trusting adjustment score and a baseline trust score for the third entity.\n7. The system of claim 6, the user device further configured to:\nreceive second data about the requesting entity from a second remote source; and\nupdate the stored trusting adjustment score based on the received second data from the second remote source.\n8. The system of claim 1, the user device further configured to:\nreceive an indication of an activity to be performed together by the requesting entity and the second entity; and\nupdate the trusting adjustment score based on the indication of the activity.\n9. The system of claim 1 wherein the second entity is associated with a second node in a network community, and a fourth entity is associated with a first node in a network community, and wherein the processing circuitry is configured to determine a baseline trust score for the second entity by:\nidentifying paths to the second node from the first node within the network community; and\ndetermining the baseline trust score for the second entity based on the identified paths.\n10. The system of claim 9 wherein the identified paths each comprise one or more links, wherein each link is assigned a user connectivity value, and wherein the processing circuitry is configured to determine the baseline trust score for the second entity based on the identified paths by:\ncombining the user connectivity values to determine the baseline trust score for the second entity based on the identified paths.\n11. The system of claim 1 wherein the received data further comprises at least one of video data, audio data, pictorial data, numerical data, or user input data.\n12. A method for adjusting, for a requesting entity, a trust score for a second entity, the method comprising:\nreceiving, at a computing device of a requesting entity from a server, a baseline trust score of a second entity, wherein the baseline trust score for the second entity was determined at a remote location using processing circuitry;\nsending, from the computing device of the requesting entity to the server, a request for an adjusted trust score for the second entity; and\nreceiving, at the computing device of the requesting entity from the server, an indication of the adjusted trust score for the second entity, wherein the adjusted trust score for the second entity was determined at the remote location using processing circuitry that performed steps including:\nreceiving data about the requesting entity from a first remote source, wherein the received data comprises text data about the requesting entity;\nretrieving, from a database, a file indicating one or more trusting keywords;\ncomparing the text data to the one or more trusting keywords to determine whether the text data contains the one or more trusting keywords;\nin response to determining that the text data contains the one or more trusting keywords, calculating a trusting adjustment score for the requesting entity based on the received data from the first remote source; and\ndetermining the adjusted trust score for the second entity by combining the trusting adjustment score and the baseline trust score for the second entity.\n13. The method of claim 12 wherein combining the trusting adjustment score and the baseline trust score for the second entity comprises multiplying the baseline trust score for the second entity by the trusting adjustment score.\n14. The method of claim 12 wherein combining the trusting adjustment score and the baseline trust score for the second entity comprises combining the baseline trust score for the second entity and the trusting adjustment score according to a weighted sum.\n15. The method of claim 14 wherein the weighted sum is based on a user-assigned weight.\n16. The method of claim 12 wherein the received data further comprises a user indication of how trusting the user believes the requesting entity to be, wherein the user is associated with a third entity that is different from the requesting entity.\n17. The method of claim 12 further comprising:\nreceiving, at the computing device of the requesting entity from the server, the trusting adjustment score for the requesting entity; and\nusing the stored trusting adjustment score to determine an adjusted trust score for a third entity by combining the stored trusting adjustment score and a baseline trust score for the third entity.\n18. The method of claim 17 further comprising:\nreceiving, at the computing device of the requesting entity, second data about the requesting entity from a second remote source; and\nupdating the stored trusting adjustment score based on the received second data from the second remote source.\n19. The method of claim 12 further comprising:\nreceiving, at the computing device of the requesting entity, an indication of an activity to be performed together by the requesting entity and the second entity; and\nupdating the trusting adjustment score based on the indication of the activity.\n20. The method of claim 12 wherein the received data further comprises at least one of video data, audio data, pictorial data, numerical data, or user input data."

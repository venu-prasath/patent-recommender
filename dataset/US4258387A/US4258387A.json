    "title": "Video telephone",
    "abstract": "An apparatus and method are provided for transmitting video data over telephone lines. The apparatus is particularly applicable for transmitting and receiving images of persons speaking to each other. In one form, a portable self-contained unit is provided at each end of a conventional telephone circuit wherein the transducers of the mouthpiece and earpiece of each telephone are respectively acoustically coupled to respective acoustic output and input electrical-to-sound and sound-to-electrical transducers of each self-contained unit for two-way audio and video communication therebetween. Each unit, which may be contained in a single housing, has a television camera directed and operative for slow scanning the face of a person making the telephone call, a television display screen and image retaining means for displaying the image of a person having a similar unit at the other end of the line, and a speaker and microphone which may be contained within the housing or in a telephone hand set for receiving speech and generating sounds of speech transmitted from the other terminal circuits. Hard copy generating means, such as a picture printer, may also be provided to print pictures of the images on the television display screen when controlled to do so.",

    "claims": "\n1. Video-audio communication apparatus comprising in combination:\na housing,\nfirst means supported by said housing for receiving and predeterminately positioning a telephone mouth-ear piece containing a microphone and speaker,\nmicrophone and speaker means supported adjacent said first means and located to be respectively acoustically coupled to the speaker and microphone of the telephone mouth-earpiece when predeterminately located and supported by said first means,\na television camera secured to and supported by said housing and directed to scan and generate picture signals of an area adjacent said housing.\nmeans for initiating and effecting automatic control of the read means of said television camera and generating a video picture signal on the output of said camera and means for applying said video picture signal to said speaker means supported adjacent said first means whereby said speaker means is modulated by said video picture signal and generates sounds in the vicinity of the microphone defining the mouthpiece of the telephone mouth-earpiece unit supported by said first means.\n2. An apparatus in accordance with claim 1 including a television receiver fixedly supported with respect to said housing adjacent said television camera, said receiver having an input connected to said microphone means supported adjacent said first means for receiving signals generated when the speaker defining the earpiece of the telephone mouth-earpiece unit supported by said first means is modulated with a video picture signal transmitted thereto on a telephone circuit connected to another terminal circuit of the telephone system on which other terminal circuit said video signal is generated.\n3. An apparatus in accordance with claim 2 wherein said housing is a portable unit and said television camera and receiver are supported within said housing.\n4. An apparatus in accordance with claim 3 in which said television receiver includes a viewing screen and means for generating a television image on said viewing screen and an opening in a wall of said housing exposing said viewing screen to the exterior of said housing.\n5. An apparatus in accordance with claim 1 including a second speaker and a second microphone fixedly supported with respect to said housing and respectively connected to the microphone means and the speaker means located adjacent said first means to permit a person in the vicinity of said housing to listen to conversation made by a person at the other end of the telephone connection and to permit the transmission of voice signals on the connected circuit.\n6. An apparatus in accordance with claim 1 wherein said television receiver includes a viewing screen and said television camera and viewing screen are disposed one above the other adjacent a wall of said housing to permit the face of a person to be scanned by said camera and the eyes of the person whose face is being scanned by said television camera to simultaneously view the viewing screen of said television receiver.\n7. An apparatus in accordance with claim 6 including a speaker and microphone located immediately adjacent said camera and viewing screen and supported fixed with respect to said housing, said microphone being operatively connected to said speaker means supported adjacent said first means, said speaker being operatively connected to said microphone means supported adjacent said first means to permit two-way voice communication to be established between a person whose face is being scanned by said television camera and a person located at the other end of the telephone line.\n8. An apparatus in accordance with claim 7 including amplifying means supported within said housing for the voice signal generated on the output of said microphone means supported adjacent said first means.\n9. Apparatus in accordance with claim 1 wherein said television camera is pivotally supported by said housing in a manner such that its scanning axis may be variably adjusted to permit it to scan in different directions with respect to said housing.\n10. Apparatus in accordance with claim 1 wherein said housing is formed of two compartments pivotally joined together with one compartment adapted to rest on a horizontal surface and the other supported thereon in a vertical attitude, said television camera being supported by said vertically extending compartment.\n11. Apparatus in accordance with claim 1 wherein said housing is formed of first and second compartments, means for securing said compartments together to form a carrying case thereof, means for supporting one of said compartments at substantially right angles to the other to permit it to be supported in a substantially vertical attitude when the other compartment is supported on a horizontal surface, a television receiver including an image viewing screen and means for securing said television camera and said receiver on the compartment which is adapted to be vertically supported to permit the camera to scan the head of a person facing said vertically supported compartment and the viewing screen of said receiver to be easily viewed by said person.\n12. An apparatus in accordance with claim 11, said first compartment containing said first means and adapted to be supported horizontally and a keyboard supported by said first compartment, electronic means connected to the keys of said keyboard for generating code signals representative of alphanumeric characters when the keys of said keyboard and depressed, means for displaying the data generated by the selective activation of the keys of said keyboard on the viewing screen of said television receiver and means for transducing said code signals to tone sounds on the output of said speaker means to provide said data in a transducible form for receipt by the microphone of the telephone mouth-earpiece predeterminately positioned by said first means to permit said data to be transmitted thereby to a remote telephone terminal circuit to which said telephone is connected.\n13. An apparatus in accordance with claim 1 wherein said television camera is adjustably supported by said housing to permit its scanning axis to be varied and to permit it to scan the head of a person facing said housing and the face of a document supported on or adjacent said housing.\n14. An apparatus in accordance with claim 1 wherein said television camera is operable to generate an analog video picture signal on its output, means for digitizing said analog picture signal, a memory for storing the digitized signals derived from a full frame video picture signal generated by said camera, means for reproducing the digital signals stored in said memory and converting same to respective sound tones in the vicinity of the microphone of the mouthpiece of the telephone mouth-earpiece supported by said first means to permit the video picture information to be transmitted on the telephone lines to a remote telephone terminal circuit to which said telephone is connected.",

    "title": "Interactive parameter driven iterative financial spreadsheet analysis with context and layout sensitive help screen",
    "abstract": "A financial analysis system for mathematically modeling an investment on a computer provides an improved computer user interface and a help method for teaching a user how to use the analysis system and for explaining the meaning of items on the screen. An investment term is broken up into two or more incremental periods and unique parameters may be associated with each incremental period so as to allow for the modeling of discrete events and permit varying of input assumptions of one or more incremental periods. In accordance with this scheme, results are displayed with each incremental period having its associated result or results. A method for displaying help text to explain the purpose, function and ordering of items displayed in a computer financial analysis system is disclosed. The help text is visually associated with an item that is displayed in context on the screen. Help text is automatically displayed in a predetermined sequence to explain items on the screen and to illustrate the logical flow of calculations performed on the items. Different help text may be displayed when the value of an item changes.",

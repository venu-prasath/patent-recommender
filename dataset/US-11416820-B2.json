    "abstract": "Systems, methods, and computer-readable media for remotely automating changes to third party applications from within a primary application are disclosed. The systems and methods may involve maintaining in the primary application, a table having rows, columns, and cells at intersections of the rows and columns, wherein the primary application is configured to enable the construction of automations defined by conditional rules for altering internal information in the primary application and external information in the third party applications; receiving an automation definition conditional on specific information input into at least one specific cell in the table of the primary application, wherein the automation definition is constructed using internal blocks and external blocks, the external blocks having links to the external third party applications; monitoring the at least one specific cell of the primary application for an occurrence of the specific information.",
    "claims": "\n1. A system for defining custom automations for a primary application, the system comprising:\nat least one processor configured to:\nmaintain in the primary application, a table having rows, columns, and cells at intersections of the rows and columns;\ncause display of a graphical user interface for defining an automation, the graphical user interface including:\na graphical representation of the automation, the graphical representation of the automation including at least one region representing a condition and at least one region representing an action;\na plurality of action blocks including at least one external block associated with a third-party application; and\na customizable object for customizing at least one aspect of the at least one external block;\nreceive, via the graphical user interface, an indication of the condition and an indication of the action, the action being selected to be performed upon occurrence of the condition, wherein receiving the indication of the at least one action includes receiving a selection of at least one of the plurality of action blocks via the graphical user interface;\nmonitor the cells of the primary application for an occurrence of the condition; and\nupon detection of the occurrence of the condition, trigger the action.\n2. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least on processor is further configured to cause display of a plurality of detailed blocks within the graphical user interface, and wherein receiving the indication of the condition includes receiving a selection of at least one of the plurality of detailed blocks via the graphical user interface.\n3. The system of claim 2, wherein the plurality of detailed blocks includes at least one internal block associated with the table of the primary application.\n4.

The system of claim 2, wherein the plurality of detailed blocks includes at least one external block associated with a third-party application.\n6. The system of claim 5, wherein the at least one external block includes a logo corresponding to the third-party application.\n7. The system of claim 5, wherein the primary application is linked to the third-party application in a manner permitting the primary application to monitor data input in the third-party application.\n8. The system of claim 2, wherein at least two of the plurality of detailed blocks are grouped into a first block group.\n9. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of action blocks further includes at least one internal block associated with the table of the primary application.\n10.

The system of claim 1, wherein the customizable object is displayed based on a selection of the at least one external block.\n12. The system of claim 1, wherein the condition of the automation includes at least two components and the at least one processor is further configured to display a connector associated with the condition.\n13. The system of claim 12, wherein the connector includes a conjunctive term.\n14. The system of claim 1, wherein the condition includes at least one parameter modifiable based on specific information input via the graphical user interface.\n15. The system of claim 14, wherein the at least one parameter includes an identification of a specific person.\n16. A method for defining custom automations for a primary application, the method comprising:\nmaintaining in the primary application, a table having rows, columns, and cells at intersections of the rows and columns;\ncausing display of a graphical user interface for defining an automation, the graphical user interface including:\na graphical representation of the automation, the graphical representation of the automation including at least one region representing a condition and at least one region representing an action;\na plurality of action blocks including at least one external block associated with a third-party application; and\na customizable object for customizing at least one aspect of the at least one external block;\nreceiving, via the graphical user interface, an indication of the condition and an indication of the action, the action being selected to be performed upon occurrence of the condition, wherein receiving the indication of the at least one action includes receiving a selection of at least one of the plurality of action blocks via the graphical user interface;\nmonitoring the cells of the primary application for an occurrence of the condition; and\nupon detection of the occurrence of the condition, triggering the action.\n17. A non-transitory computer readable medium containing instructions that when executed by at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to perform operations for defining custom automations for a primary application, the operations comprising:\nmaintaining in the primary application, a table having rows, columns, and cells at intersections of the rows and columns;\ncausing display of a graphical user interface for defining an automation, the graphical user interface including:\na graphical representation of the automation, the graphical representation of the automation including at least one region representing a condition and at least one region representing an action;\na plurality of action blocks including at least one external block associated with a third-party application; and\na customizable object for customizing at least one aspect of the at least one external block;\nreceiving, via the graphical user interface, an indication of the condition and an indication of the action, the action being selected to be performed upon occurrence of the condition, wherein receiving the indication of the at least one action includes receiving a selection of at least one of the plurality of action blocks via the graphical user interface;\nmonitoring the cells of the primary application for an occurrence of the condition; and\nupon detection of the occurrence of the condition, triggering the action."

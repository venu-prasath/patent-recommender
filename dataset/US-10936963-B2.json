    "abstract": "Techniques for predicting a user response to content are described. According to various embodiments, a configuration file is accessed, where the configuration file includes a user-specification of raw data accessible via external data sources and raw data encoding rules. In some embodiments, the raw data includes raw member data associated with a particular member and raw content data associated with a particular content item. Thereafter, source modules encode the raw data from the external data sources into feature vectors, based on the raw data encoding rules. An assembler module assembles one or more of the feature vectors into an assembled feature vector, based on user-specified assembly rules included in the configuration file. A prediction module performs a prediction modeling process based on the assembled feature vector and a prediction model, to predict a likelihood of the particular member performing a particular user action on the particular content item.",

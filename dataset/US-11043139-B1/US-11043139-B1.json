    "abstract": "Systems and methods for personalized digital goal setting and intervention are provided. Embodiments of the system allow for effective management and implementation of interventions to change behaviors or health statuses of individuals or groups. Systems and methods may include setting a measurement goal relating to a behavior or a health status and generating a marker based on the measurement goal, receiving sensor data, determining that at least one of the measurement goal or the marker is satisfied, and executing a triggering action. The triggering action may include at least one of controlling access to a user device, controlling access to an application stored on a user device, controlling access of a user device to a network, controlling access of a user device to a website, displaying a notification on the user device, or transmitting a command to a remote device, including an instruction to control access to a physical space.",

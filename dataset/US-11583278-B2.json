The end effector comprises a first jaw, a second jaw rotatable relative to the first jaw between an open position and a closed position, and a staple cartridge comprising staples. The shaft defines first and second articulation joints. The end effector is movable about the first articulation joint in a first articulation plane and about the second articulation joint in a second articulation plane. The drive member traverses the first articulation joint and the second articulation joint and is configured to space the second jaw relative to the first jaw. Actuation of the first and second cables moves the end effector within the first articulation plane. Actuation of the second and third cables moves the end effector within the second articulation plane.",

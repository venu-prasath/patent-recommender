    "title": "Devices, softwares and methods for automated execution of conditional securities trade orders and interfaces for entering the same",
    "abstract": "Devices, such as computers, softwares and methods for brokers and/or exchanges to permit trading entities (TEs) to enter conditional executable trade orders (CTOs). These are Trade Orders (TOs) that are executed according to a decision tree, which is followed depending on whether conditions are met or not. Each condition may be associated with the decision tree, or with a particular TO. Conditions include when a time is reached, a security price reaches a threshold, when an available balance becomes sufficient, when a prior TO has indeed been executed, etc. In a \u201cchain\u201d group of embodiments, TOs are given sequentially along at least a branch of the decision tree. At least one of them is a CTO. When the CTO is considered and its individual conditions are not met, it is not executed, which further prevents the next TO in the chain from becoming active (and its conditions, if any, from being considered). This permits day trading without real time supervision. In addition, methods and interfaces for a TE to enter such a chain of TOs for execution in a computer of a broker.",

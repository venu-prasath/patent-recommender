    "title": "System for managing flow bandwidth utilization at network, transport and application layers in store and forward network",
    "abstract": "In a packet communication environment, a method is provided for classifying packet network flows for use in determining a policy, or rule of assignment of a service level, and enforcing that policy by direct rate control. The method comprises applying individual instances of traffic objects, i.e., packet network flows to a classification model based on selectable information obtained from a plurality of layers of a multi-layered communication protocol, then mapping the flow to the defined traffic classes, which are arbitrarily assignable by an offline manager which creates the classification. It is useful to note that the classification need not be a complete enumeration of the possible traffic.",

    "title": "System and method for accessing and updating a continuously broadcasted stored database",
    "abstract": "A broadcast oriented architecture for a data storage access system is disclosed. The architecture permits the implementation of high capacity query intensive data bases for mass market public applications such as directory assistance systems. In the architecture, a record storage pump cyclically transmits the entire data base over a downstream channel formed from a transmission medium such as an optical fiber. Record retrieval elements located at different positions along the downstream channel read the entire data base during each cycle and pick out requested records from the data base. An upstream channel between the record retrieval elements and the record storage pump is used to transmit data base update information from the record retrieval elements to the record storage pump to provide each record retrieval element with a consistent view of the updated data base during subsequent data base broadcast cycles.",

    "claims": "\n1. In an architecture comprising a memory for storing a database, means for cyclically broadcasting the database over a downstream transmission channel, a plurality of processing elements located along the downstream channel for reading the database during each broadcast cycle, an upstream channel via which information is transmitted from said processing elements to said memory, and update means in communication with said upstream channel and said memory, a method for concurrently performing a plurality of queries comprising the steps of\nmaintaining in said memory a database comprising a plurality of records, each of which record comprises a plurality of fields,\ncyclically broadcasting via said downstream channel said database,\nat said processing elements, concurrently executing a plurality of queries on said database by accessing particular records from said database using content addressing by the steps of\nat each processing element, successively storing each record of said database during each broadcast cycle of said database,\nat each processing element, storing one or more content attributes associated with each query to be executed at the processing element,\nat each processing element, comparing said content attributes stored therein with the contents of one or more fields of each of said records stored in the processing element during each broadcast cycle, and\nindicating when a query is satisfied by one of said records,\ntransmitting update requests of records identified in response to said queries from said processing elements via said upstream channel to said update means, and\nupdating said database maintained in said memory in a non-conflicting manner in response to said update requests by using said update means to receive said update request and to resolve conflicts among said update requests.\n2. An access system for a stored database comprising a plurality of records, said access system comprising\na memory for storing a database comprising a plurality of records, each of which records comprises a plurality of fields,\nbroadcasting means for cyclically broadcasting said database over a downstream transmission channel so that during each successive broadcast cycle of said database the records of the database are transmitted over said downstream channel,\na plurality of processing elements which do not directly communicate with one another and which are located along said downstream transmission channel for concurrently reading the database during each broadcast cycle and for executing queries by identifying particular records in said database using content addressing, each of said processing elements comprising record storage means for successively storing each record of the database during each broadcast cycle of the database, content attribute storage means for storing at least one content attribute associated with a query, comparing means for comparing said at least one content attribute with the contents of one or more fields of each of said records while each of said records is stored in said record storage means, and means responsive to said comparing means for indicating when a query is satisfied by one of said records,\nan upstream channel in communication with said processing elements for transmitting record update requests from said processing elements,\nupdate means in communication with said memory and said upstream channel for receiving said update requests, for resolving conflicts among said update requests, and for carrying out said update requests to update said database in a non-conflicting manner.",

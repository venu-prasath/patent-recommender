    "title": "Apparatus and Method for Constructing Prediction Model",
    "abstract": "A prediction model constructing apparatus includes a operational result database, similarity calculating means, and prediction model constructing means. The operational result database relates manufacturing conditions of a product manufactured in the past to result information on the manufacturing, and stores a plurality pieces of information obtained by relating the manufacturing conditions to the result information. The similarity calculating means calculates a similarity composed of a plurality of comparison results by comparing the manufacturing conditions stored in the operational result database with a manufacturing condition of a prediction target. The prediction model constructing means determines a parameter of a prediction model corresponding to the manufacturing condition of the prediction target.",

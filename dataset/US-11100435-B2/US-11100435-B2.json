    "abstract": "An artificial intelligence system for communicating predicted hours of operation to a client device. The system may include a processor in communication with a client device and a database; and a storage medium storing instructions. When executed, the instructions in the storage medium configure the processor to: receive, from the client device, a request for hours of operation of a merchant, the request specifying a day of the week; obtain, from the database in response to the request, a set of credit card authorizations associated with the merchant; determine a selected day authorizations subset by selecting, from the set of credit card authorizations, credit card authorizations issued on the specified day of the week; generate a posted transaction array based on the selected day authorizations subset, the posted transaction array may include a plurality of time intervals and numbers of transactions for the time intervals; generate a predictions list based on the posted transaction array, the predictions list including the time intervals and prediction indications for the time intervals; and communicate the predictions list to the client device.",

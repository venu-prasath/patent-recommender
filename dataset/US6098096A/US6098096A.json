    "title": "Method and apparatus for dynamic cache preloading across a network",
    "abstract": "A caching server that provides faster access times for independently operating network elements. The caching server initiates information transfer and holds the requested information in its memory, instead of caching information transfer in response to user requests. The caching server preloads information from another server into its memory based on a set of predetermined criteria. Such preloading preferably occurs during low usage time, such as nighttime. The information source determines which information is described in the catalog in accordance with one of a second set of predetermined criteria. For example, the catalog may be organized according to size and the information source will organize the catalog by file size. The caching server preloads as many often-used files as will fit in its cache memory",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for quickly accessing information in a network that includes an origin system and a user computer, each connected to a caching server, the method comprising the steps, performed by the caching server of:\nrequesting a catalog from the origin system that lists documents available to be downloaded from the origin system, the documents selected by the origin system according to a first predetermined criterion of the caching server;\nreceiving the catalog from the origin system;\nselecting a document from the catalog according to a second predetermined criterion of the caching server:\nrequesting the selected document described in the catalog from the origin system;\nreceiving the selected document from the origin system; and\nstoring the selected document in a cache memory of the caching server, thereby making the selected document available to the user computer through the caching server before a request for the selected document is received from the user computer.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein the user computer is connected to the caching server through the network, the method further including the steps performed by the caching server of:\nreceiving, by the caching server, a request for the selected document from the user computer; and\nsending, from the caching server over the network, the selected document stored in the cache memory to the user computer.\n3. The method of claim 2, further including the steps performed by the caching server of:\ndetermining a portion of the cache memory to be used for storing preloaded documents; and\nrepeating the steps of selecting a document, requesting the selected document, receiving the selected document and storing the selected document until the determined portion of the cache memory is full of preloaded documents that meet the second predetermined criterion, or until no further documents in the catalog meet the second predetermined criterion.\n4. The method of claim 3, further including the steps of:\nreceiving from the user computer a request for a new document that has not been preloaded into the cache memory of the caching server;\nrequesting the new document from the origin system;\nreceiving via the network the new document from the origin system; and\nsending via the network the new document to the user computer.\n5. The method of claim 4, further including the steps of:\nstoring the new document in the cache memory;\nwherein non-preloaded documents stored in the cache memory are purged to free cache memory space when the cache memory is full to make storage space available for the new document.\n6. The method of claim 5, further including the step, between the steps of receiving the catalog from the origin system and selecting a document, of purging preloaded documents stored in the determined portion of the cache memory to make storage space available for the selected document.\n7. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of requesting a catalog from the origin system performed during a low usage time of the network.\n8. The method of claim 1, wherein the caching server includes a client and a caching system and wherein the step of requesting a catalog from the origin system includes the steps of:\nsending the request for the catalog from the client to the caching system; and\nsending the request for the catalog from the caching system to the origin system.\n9. The method of claim 1, wherein the caching server includes a client and a caching system and wherein the step of requesting a document described in the catalog includes the steps of:\nsending the request for selected document from the client to the caching system; and\nsending the request for selected document from the caching system to the origin system.\n10. The method of claim 1, wherein the second predetermined criterion used by the caching server to determine whether to request a document from the catalog is based on the size of the document.\n11. The method of claim 1, wherein the second predetermined criterion used by the caching server to determine whether to request a document from the catalog is based on a rating associated with the document and stored in the catalog.\n12. The method of claim 1, wherein the second predetermined criterion used by the caching server to determine whether to request a document from the catalog is based on a list of non-acceptable document names.\n13. The method of claim 1, wherein the network includes a second caching server and the first and second caching servers receive different catalogs from the origin system.\n14. The method of claim 1, wherein the network includes a second caching server and the first and the second caching servers request different documents from the origin system.\n15. The method of claim 1, wherein the origin system and the caching server use http protocol to communicate.\n16. The method of claim 1, wherein the caching server includes a client and a caching system and further including the steps of:\nsending, by the client to the caching system, an instruction to retain the document in the cache memory for a specified amount of time; and\nretaining the document in the cache memory, by the caching system, for the specified amount of time.\n17. The method of claim 1, wherein the caching server includes a client and a caching system and further including the steps of:\nsending, by the client to the caching system, an instruction to purge the document from the cache memory; and\npurging the document from the cache memory, by the caching system.\n18. A caching server having a cache memory, the caching server being part of a network that includes an origin system and at least one user computer connected to the caching server through the network, the caching server comprising:\na first portion configured to request a catalog from the origin system that lists documents available to be downloaded from the origin system, the documents selected by the origin system according to a first predetermined criterion of the caching server;\na second portion configured to receive the catalog from the origin system;\na third portion configured to select a document from the catalog according to a second predetermined criterion of the caching server;\na fourth portion configured to request the selected document described in the catalog from the origin system;\na fifth portion configured to receive the selected document from the origin system;\na sixth portion configured to store the selected document in the cache memory;\na seventh portion configured to receive a request for the selected document from the at least one user computer; and\na eighth portion configured to send the requested document stored in the cache memory to the at least one user computer.\n19. The caching server of claim 18, wherein the caching server includes a client and a caching system and wherein the first portion includes:\na ninth portion configured to send the request for the catalog from the client to the caching system; and\na tenth portion configured to send the request for the catalog from the caching system to the origin system.\n20. A computer program product comprising:\na computer usable medium having computer readable code embodied therein for causing access to information stored on a network having a origin system, a caching server, and at least one user computer, the computer program product comprising:\ncomputer readable program code devices configured to cause a computer to effect requesting a catalog from the origin system that lists documents available to be downloaded from the origin system, the documents selected according to a first predetermined criterion of the caching server;\ncomputer readable program code devices configured to cause a computer to effect receiving the catalog from the origin system;\ncomputer readable program code devices configured to cause a computer to effect selecting a document from the catalog according to a second predetermined criterion of the caching server;\ncomputer readable program code devices configured to cause a computer to effect requesting the selected document described in the catalog from the origin system;\ncomputer readable program code devices configured to cause a computer to effect receiving the selected document from the origin system;\ncomputer readable program code devices configured to cause a computer to effect storing the selected document in the cache memory;\ncomputer readable program code devices configured to cause a computer to effect receiving a request for the selected document from the at least one user computer; and\ncomputer readable program code devices configured to cause a computer to effect sending the requested document stored in the cache memory to the user computer.",

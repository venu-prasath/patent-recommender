    "claims": "\n1. A method of executing an order in a market system comprises:\nreceiving an order from a market participant; and\nfor the order, checking if a market participant identification associated with the order matches a market participant identification representing a quote in the system which is at the best bid or best offer price in the system.\n2. The method of claim 1 further comprising:\nmatching-off the order against the one of the best bid or best offer that is at the opposite side of the market.\n3. The method of claim 1 further comprises:\nmatching-off the order without regard to a time priority of other quotes in the system, against the one of the best bid or best offer that is at the opposite side of the market.\n4. The method of claim 1 further comprising:\ncalling a cancel request to cancel a quote at the side of the market in which a matched off order will be executed.\n5.

    "abstract": "Techniques for detecting and correcting anomalies in computer-based reasoning systems are provided herein. The techniques can include obtaining current context data and determining a contextually-determined action based on the obtained context data and a reasoning model. The reasoning model may have been determined based on multiple sets of training data. The techniques may cause performance of the contextually-determined action and, potentially, receiving an indication that performing the contextually-determined action in the current context resulted in an anomaly. The techniques include determining a portion of the reasoning model that caused the determination of the contextually-determined action based on the obtained context data and causing removal of the portion of the model that caused the determination of the contextually-determined action, to produce a corrected reasoning model. Subsequently, second context data is obtained, a second action is determined based on that data and the corrected reasoning model, and the second contextually-determined action can be performed.",

    "abstract": "A computerized method of assigning a building automation system point type to a plurality of unclassified data points is provided. The method includes receiving unclassified data points and attributes for each data point. The method includes receiving classifications for a first subset of the unclassified data points. Each classification associates a data point with a building automation system point type. The method includes generating a term set containing substrings that appear in the attributes. The method includes generating a first matrix describing a frequency that the substrings appear in the attributes. The method includes calculating an indicator of a probability that the presence of the selected substring results in the data point belonging to the selected point type. The method includes assigning a point type to a second subset by finding the substring and potential point type pair having the greatest indication of probability.",
    "claims": "\n1. A building system of a building comprising one or more storage devices having instructions stored thereon that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to:\nreceive a plurality of strings in a first syntax representing a plurality of entities of the building;\nidentify the plurality of entities of the building in a second syntax different than the first syntax and a plurality of relationships between the plurality of entities by analyzing the plurality of strings with a classification technique, the classification technique indicating an entity definition of the second syntax for each of the plurality of entities; and\ngenerate a data structure in the second syntax based on the entity definition of the second syntax for each of the plurality of entities and the plurality of relationships.\n2. The building system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of entities of the building comprise at least one of points, equipment, and building spaces of the building.\n3. The building system of claim 1, wherein the instructions cause the one or more processors to:\ngenerate a user interface comprising indications of the plurality of entities of the building in the second syntax;\ncause a user device to display the user interface; and\nreceive, via the user device, an indication of one or more of the plurality of relationships from the user device based on one or more user interactions with the user interface.\n4. The building system of claim 1, wherein the one or more storage devices store a list of known entity types;\nwherein the instructions cause the one or more processors to assign one known entity type of the list of known entity types to each of the plurality of strings.\n5. The building system of claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of entities are points of a plurality of pieces of equipment of the building.\n6.

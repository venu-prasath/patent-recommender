    "abstract": "Techniques for calculating probability of hire scores in a streaming environment are described. In an embodiment, a system accesses a candidate stream definition comprising a hiring organization and a role. Additionally, the system accesses, based on the candidate stream definition, one or more stream-related information sources, and extracts attributes from the stream-related information sources. Moreover, the system identifies similar organizations based on the attributes, the role, and features of the hiring organization. Then, the system accesses historical data regarding hiring patterns at the similar organizations for the role. The system calculates, based on the historical data and interactions by the hiring organization with member profiles of an online system (e.g., hosting a social networking service), a probability of hire for the role. Next, the system presents the probability of hire. In some embodiments, the system identifies the similar organizations by identifying related roles based on the attributes and the role.",

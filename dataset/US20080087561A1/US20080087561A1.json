    "title": "Topping Tool",
    "abstract": "A topping tool assembly comprises a bag support defining a tapered receptacle having an open bag receiving end and an open dispensing end narrower than the bag receiving end, a mounting bracket fixed to the bag support, and an anchor bracket, wherein the mounting bracket and the anchor bracket are adapted such that the mounting bracket removably mounts onto the anchor bracket. The topping tool assembly is installed in a kitchen or other food preparation area by attaching the anchor bracket to a suitable supporting surface, and it receives and supports a pastry bag in a generally vertical orientation such that a top of the pastry hag is exposed through the bag receiving end of the bag support and a bottom decorative tip of the pastry bag protrudes from the bottom dispensing end of the bag support. When a pastry bag is supported in this manner, a user may manually apply pressure at the top of the pastry bag and locate a pastry, cake, or other item just beneath the dispensing end while the dispensing tip of the pastry bag remains at a constant position and orientation.",

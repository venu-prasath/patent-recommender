    "abstract": "System and method for amplifying the accuracy of forecasts generated by software systems that harness the collective intelligence of human populations by curating optimized sub-populations through an intelligent selection process. Participants predict event outcomes and/or provide evaluations of their confidence in their predictions. The system determines a score wherein the alignment score indicates how well that participant's prediction aligns with the predictions given by the baseline population. Participants can then be selected from the population based on the participant alignment scores.",

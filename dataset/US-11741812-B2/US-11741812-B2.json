    "claims": "\n1. A risk management system comprising:\none or more computer-readable storage media storing:\na data structure, wherein the data structure comprises a plurality of vulnerability values indicating vulnerability levels for an asset based on a plurality of threat types; and\ninstructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to:\nreceive a threat to the asset, the threat comprising a particular threat type of the plurality of threat types;\nretrieve a particular vulnerability value from the data structure based on the particular threat type responsive to receipt of the threat;\ndetermine, based on the particular vulnerability value and the threat, a risk value associated with the asset; and\ngenerate a risk card based on the risk value associated with the asset.\n2. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the risk card comprises an indication of the asset and the risk value associated with the asset.\n3. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the risk card comprises an indication of the asset and the risk value associated with the asset.\n4. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the risk card is based on the risk value associated with the asset and the vulnerability levels of the asset.\n5. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the risk card is based on the risk value associated with the asset and the vulnerability levels for the asset, the risk card further comprises:\nan indication of the asset;\nthe risk value associated with the asset; and\nthe vulnerability levels associated with each of the plurality of threat types for the asset.\n6. The risk management system of claim 1, further comprising a user interface to display the risk card.\n7. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the asset is at least one of a user, a space, a building, or a device.\n8. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of vulnerability values is a numeric value indicating an amount that the asset is affected by each of the plurality of threat types, wherein the numeric value is between zero and one.\n9. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the data structure is a matrix comprising a first dimension, wherein a plurality of assets including the asset are associated with the first dimension.\n10. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the data structure is a matrix comprising a first dimension and a second dimension, wherein a plurality of assets including the asset are associated with the first dimension and the plurality of threat types are associated with the second dimension.\n11. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the instructions cause the one or more processors to:\nprovide a data structure retrieve endpoint, wherein the data structure retrieve endpoint is configured to provide the data structure to a requesting device; and\nprovide a data structure update endpoint, wherein the data structure update endpoint is configured to update vulnerabilities of the data structure based on updates received from the requesting device.\n12. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the instructions cause the one or more processors to:\nreceive, via a user interface, a first update to a vulnerability associated with the asset and the particular threat type; and\nupdate the data structure with the first update to the vulnerability; generate, for the asset, a set of threat types that the asset is vulnerable to based on the data structure, wherein the set of threat types are threat types that affect the risk value of the asset;\ncause the user interface to display the set of threat types;\nreceive, via the user interface, a second update to the set of threat types, the second update comprising an indication to add one or more new threat types, wherein the data structure does not indicate that the risk value of the asset is affected by the one or more new threat types; and\nupdate the plurality of vulnerability values of the data structure based on the second update by adding vulnerabilities based on the indication to add the one or more new threat types of the set of threat types.\n13.

The method of claim 13, wherein the data structure is a matrix comprising a first dimension and a second dimension, wherein the plurality of assets including the particular asset are associated with the first dimension and the plurality of threat types are associated with the second dimension.\n17. The method of claim 13, comprising:\nproviding, by the one or more processing circuits, a data structure retrieve endpoint, wherein the data structure retrieve endpoint is configured to provide the data structure to a requesting device; and\nproviding, by the one or more processing circuits, a data structure update endpoint, wherein the data structure update endpoint is configured to update vulnerabilities of the data structure based on updates received from the requesting device.\n18. The method of claim 13, comprising:\nreceiving, by the one or more processing circuits, via a user interface, an update to a vulnerability associated with the particular asset and the particular threat type; and\nupdating, by the one or more processing circuits, the data structure with the update to the vulnerability.\n19. A risk management system, comprising:\none or more computer-readable storage media having instructions stored thereon that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to:\nreceive a plurality of threat events indicating a potential threat to one or more of a plurality of assets, the plurality of threat events associated with a plurality of threat categories, the plurality of assets associated with a plurality of locations;\nfor each asset of the plurality of assets:\ndetermine one or more of the plurality of threat events affecting the asset; and generate a risk score for each of the plurality of assets based on the plurality of threat events determined to affect the asset;\ngenerate a location-specific aggregated risk score for two or more of the plurality of locations based on a combination of the risk score of at least some the plurality of assets associated with the plurality of locations;\ngenerate a category-specific risk metric indicating, for each of at least two or more of the plurality of threat categories, a number of threat events associated with the plurality of threat categories;\ngenerate user interface data including, within a single interface, visual representations of both location-specific aggregated risk scores for the two or more of the plurality of locations and category-specific risk metrics for the two or more of the plurality of threat categories;\ngenerate a risk card, based on the user interface data; and\ncause the risk card to be displayed on a display device.\n20.

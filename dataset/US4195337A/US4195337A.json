    "title": "Control method utilizing a model control scheme",
    "abstract": "A control method is described in which, a plant, a reference model and a corrector are serially connected in the loop. The plant output is fed back and compared against a reference signal to develop an error signal. The reference mode operates upon the error signal with a predetermined transfer function to develop signals proportional to the error signal and various successive order derivatives of the error signal. The model output signals are applied to a corrector circuit which multiplies the respective model output signals by appropriate coefficients, and sums the resultant product signals to produce control signals for the plant. Provisions are also disclosed for varying the coefficients to provide self-adaptive control. Provisions for accommodating process delays are also provided.",

    "abstract": "Data are maintained in a distributed computing system that describe a graph. The graph represents relationships among items. The graph has a plurality of vertices that represent the items and a plurality of edges connecting the plurality of vertices. At least one vertex of the plurality of vertices includes a set of label values indicating the at least one vertex's strength of association with a label from a set of labels. The set of labels describe possible characteristics of an item represented by the at least one vertex. At least one edge of the plurality of edges includes a set of label weights for influencing label values that traverse the at least one edge. A label propagation algorithm is executed for a plurality of the vertices in the graph in parallel for a series of synchronized iterations to propagate labels through the graph.",

    "title": "Consolidation of earth formation using epoxy-modified resins",
    "abstract": "A method of consolidating an unconsolidated earth formation on order to improve subsequent oil recovery by means of a fluid drive, comprising treating the formation with (1) a liquid hydrocarbon preflush, (2) a resinous solution containing an epoxy resin forming material, an amine curing agent, an organic ester of a pentavalent phosphorus compound coupling agent and, if desired, optimally adding a silane, said additives being dispersed or dissolved in a liquid solvent and (3) and optimally if desired using an overflush comprising of a hydrocarbon liquid.",

    "claims": "\n2. The process of claim 1 wherein the preflush liquid (a) is a mixture of diesel oil and isopropyl alcohol the solvent (b) is a polar-containing solvent, the curing agent is an aromatic amine and the phosphate ester is a triaryl phosphate.\n3. The process of claim 2 wherein the triaryl phosphate is triphenyl phosphate.\n4. The process of claim 3 wherein after the formation is consolidated it is water flooded to recover oil.\n5.

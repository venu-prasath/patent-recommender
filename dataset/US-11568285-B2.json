    "abstract": "Various examples are provided related to identification of protected information elements associated with unique entities in data files present in data file collections associated with enterprise IT networks. The unique entities can be associated with one or more entity identifications in one or more data files. Computer-generated identification of entity identifications and protected information elements can be conducted, in part, by at least some human review. Information generated accordingly to the disclosed methodology can be used to generate plans for a time and number of human reviewers needed to review data files. Information generated from the processes herein can be configured as user notifications, reports, dashboards, machine learning for subsequent data file analyses, and notifications of unique entities having protected information elements present in one or more data files.",

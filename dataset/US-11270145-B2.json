    "abstract": "Approaches for interpretable counting for visual question answering include a digital image processor, a language processor, and a counter. The digital image processor identifies objects in an image, maps the identified objects into an embedding space, generates bounding boxes for each of the identified objects, and outputs the embedded objects paired with their bounding boxes. The language processor embeds a question into the embedding space. The scorer determines scores for the identified objects. Each respective score determines how well a corresponding one of the identified objects is responsive to the question. The counter determines a count of the objects in the digital image that are responsive to the question based on the scores. The count and a corresponding bounding box for each object included in the count are output. In some embodiments, the counter determines the count interactively based on interactions between counted and uncounted objects.",
    "claims": "\n1. A system for counting objects in a digital image, the system comprising:\na digital image processor that identifies objects in an image and maps the identified objects into an embedding space;\na language processor that embeds a question into the embedding space;\na scorer that determines scores for the identified objects, each respective score determines how well a corresponding one of the identified objects is responsive to the question; and\na counter that determines a count of the objects in the digital image that are responsive to the question based on the scores.\n2. The system of claim 1, wherein the counter:\ndetermines whether to add a first identified object to the count;\niteratively applies an interaction filter to remaining identified objects to determine an uncounted object that is most likely responsive to the question based on each previously counted object;\nwith each iteration, determines whether to add said uncounted object to the count; and\ndetermines when to terminate processing objects in the image.\n3. The system of claim 2, wherein the counter determines the first identified object to count by identifying which of the identified objects has a highest measure of match to the embedding of the question.\n4. The system of claim 3, wherein to determine when to terminate processing objects in the image, the counter determines whether the highest measure of match is less than a termination value.\n5. The system of claim 2, wherein the counter determines the interaction filter for a first unselected object of the identified objects based on the embedding of the question, the embedded object corresponding to the first identified object, and the embedded object corresponding to the first unselected object.\n6. The system of claim 1, wherein the counter generates the count based on a weighted sum of the scores.\n7. The system of claim 1, wherein the question is a natural language question.\n8. The system of claim 1, wherein the system outputs the count.\n9. The system of claim 1, wherein the digital image processor generates bounding boxes for each of the identified objects.\n10. The system of claim 9, wherein the system outputs the corresponding bounding box for each object included in the count.\n11. A method comprising:\nreceiving, by a digital image processor, an image;\nidentifying, by the digital image processor, objects in an image;\nembedding, by the digital image processor, the identified objects into an embedding space;\nreceiving, by a language processor, a question;\nmapping, by the language processor, the question into the embedding space;\ndetermining, by a scorer, scores for the identified objects, each respective score determining how well a corresponding one of the identified objects is responsive to the question; and\ndetermining, by a counter, a count of the objects in the image that are responsive to the question based on the scores.\n12. The method of claim 11, wherein determining the count comprises:\ndetermining whether to add a first identified object to the count;\niteratively applying an interaction filter to remaining identified objects to determine an uncounted object that is most likely responsive to the question based on each previously counted object;\nwith each iteration, determining whether to add said uncounted object to the count; and\ndetermining when to terminate counting objects in the image.\n13. The method of claim 12, wherein determining the first identified object to count comprises identifying which of the identified objects has a highest measure of match to the embedding of the question.\n14. The method of claim 13, wherein determining when to terminate processing objects in the image comprises determining whether the highest measure of match is less than a termination value.\n15. The method of claim 12, further comprising determining the interaction filter for a first unselected object of the identified objects based on the embedding of the question, the embedding corresponding to the first identified object, and the embedding corresponding to the first unselected object.\n16. The method of claim 11, wherein generating the count comprises determining a weighted sum of the scores.\n17. The method of claim 11, wherein the question is a natural language question.\n18. The method of claim 11, further comprising outputting the count.\n19. The method of claim 11, further comprising generating, by the digital image processor, bounding boxes for each of the identified objects.\n20. The method of claim 19, further comprising outputting the corresponding bounding box for each object included in the count."

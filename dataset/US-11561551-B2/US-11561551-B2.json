    "abstract": "Systems and methods are provided for vehicle navigation. In one implementation, a system may comprise at least one processor. The processor may be programmed to receive images representative of an environment of the host vehicle and analyze the images to identify a first object and a second object. The processor may determine a first predefined navigational constraint implicated by the first object and a second predefined navigational constraint implicated by the second object, wherein the first and second predefined navigational constraints cannot both be satisfied, and the second predefined navigational constraint has a priority higher than the first predefined navigational constraint. The processor may determine a navigational action for the host vehicle satisfying the second predefined navigational constraint, but not satisfying the first predefined navigational constraint and, cause an adjustment of a navigational actuator of the host vehicle in response to the determined navigational action.",

    "title": "Web survey tool builder and result compiler",
    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a software tool that permits creation of electronic surveys and the automatic collection and tabulation of survey results corresponding to user responses. Using the tool, a survey is automatically created and posted at a Web site address. With a Web client, or browser, computer users access the URL and complete the survey via the Web. Survey results are collected in a relational database as each user completes the survey. Thereafter, statistical tools or other analytical software applications may be applied to data mine the tabulated results.",

The computer system for performing a survey over a computer network as recited in claim 1 wherein said network server system further comprises:\n7. The computer system for performing a survey over a computer network as recited in claim 1 wherein said network server system further comprises:\n8. The computer system for performing a survey over a computer network as recited in claim 1 wherein said network server system is further adapted to enable said client computer to access survey results sent to said dynamic survey system from a second client computer.\n9. A networked computer system having at least a first computer, said first computer having a CPU, a memory, a browser, a display device and an input device and a means for conducting an electronic survey on a network comprising:\n10. The networked computer system of claim 9 further comprising storing responses to said survey questions in said tables and for summarizing and presenting results of said responses to said questions.\n11. The networked computer system of claim 9 further comprising a second computer, having a second CPU, a second memory, a second display device and a second input device, connected by a network connection to said first computer, said second computer further having a second browser resident in said second memory for accessing said Web page and for providing responses to said survey questions, said responses stored in at least one of said tables resident in the memory of said first computer.\n12. The networked computer system of claim 11 further comprising means for selecting at least one of said tables and for transferring selected information stored in said tables to the display of said second computer without requiring said second computer to have a survey system disposed therein.\n13. The networked computer system of claim 9, wherein said electronic survey is dynamically modified by adding at least one of said plurality of tables.\n14. The networked computer system of claim 9, wherein said electronic survey is dynamically modified by modifying at least one of said plurality of tables.\n15. A method for conducting a survey on the Internet comprising:\n16. The method of claim 15 further comprising the steps of:\n17. The method of claim 15 further comprising the steps of:\n18. The method of claim 17 further comprising the step of modifying the data set contained in said table selected in response to said further input.\n19. The method of claim 17 further comprising the step of transmitting at least a selected portion of the accessed table.\n20. The method recited in claim 15, further comprising the steps of:\n21. The method recited in claim 15, further comprising the steps of:\n22. In a network system having a server with a memory and network connections, said server having application software, including a relational database, resident in the memory, a method for invoking said application software from a computer connected to said server by said network connections, said method comprising:\n23. The method of claim 22 further comprising the steps of:\n24. The method of claim 22 wherein said sequence of surveys is dynamically modified by adding an additional survey to said sequence of surveys.\n25. The method of claim 22 wherein said sequence of surveys is dynamically modified by modifying at least one of said sequence of surveys.",

    "title": "Encoding apparatus and encoding method",
    "abstract": "The characteristic of a digital video signal is detected by first characteristic detecting circuit, and the characteristic of a digital speech signal is detected by second characteristic circuit. Outputs of the first and second characteristic detecting circuit are synthesized by synthesizing circuit to control allocated information quantities of compression encoding of the digital video signal and the digital speech signal on the basis of an output of the synthesizing circuit, thereby making it possible to more efficiently compression-encode video signal and speech signal related thereto in the state of less degradation from a viewpoint of visual and auditory senses at the time of reproduction.",

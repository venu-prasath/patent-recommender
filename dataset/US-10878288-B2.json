    "abstract": "An object is to provide a database construction system for machine-learning that can automatically simply create virtual image data and teacher data in large volumes. A database construction system for machine-learning includes: a three-dimensional shape data input unit configured to input three-dimensional shape information about a topographic feature or a building acquired at three-dimensional shape information measuring means; a three-dimensional simulator unit configured to automatically recognize and sort environment information from the three-dimensional shape information; and a teacher data output unit configured to output virtual sensor data and teacher data based on the environment information recognized at the three-dimensional simulator unit and a sensor parameter of a sensor.",
    "claims": "\n1. A database construction system for machine-learning comprising:\na three-dimensional shape data input unit configured to input three-dimensional shape information about a topographic feature or a building acquired at a three-dimensional shape information measuring means;\na three-dimensional simulator unit configured to input vehicle information and automatically recognize and sort environment information from the three-dimensional shape information; and\na teacher data output unit configured to output virtual sensor data and teacher data based on the environment information recognized at the three-dimensional simulator unit, the vehicle information and a sensor parameter of a sensor,\nwherein the three-dimensional shape data input unit includes:\na topographic three-dimensional shape data input unit configured to input the three-dimensional shape information, and\nan object three-dimensional shape data input unit configured to input three-dimensional shape data of a given object; and\nwherein the three-dimensional simulator unit includes a three-dimensional virtual space generating unit configured to integrate information of the topographic three-dimensional shape data input unit with information of the three-dimensional shape data input unit to generate virtual space.\n2.

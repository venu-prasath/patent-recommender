    "title": "User interface for a financial advisory system",
    "abstract": "A user interface for a financial advisory system is provided. According to one aspect of the present invention, a user may interactively explore how changes in one or more input decisions such as a risk tolerance, a savings level, and a retirement age affect one or more output values such as a probability of achieving a financial goal or an indication of short-term risk. A first and second visual indication are concurrently displayed. The first visual indication includes input mechanisms, such as slider bars, for receiving the input decisions. The second visual indication includes a set of output values that are based upon the input decisions and a recommended set of financial products. After updated values for the input decisions are received via the input mechanisms, a new recommended set of financial products and a new set of output values may be determined based upon the updated values. The second visual indication may then be updated to reflect the new set of output values. According to another aspect of the present invention, a graphical input mechanism for receiving a desired level of investment risk may be calibrated. A set of available financial products, such as a set of mutual funds, and a predefined volatility, such as the volatility of the Market Portfolio are received. The settings associated with the graphical input mechanism are constrained based upon the set of available financial products. Additionally, the calibration of the units of the graphical input mechanism may be expressed as a relationship between the volatility associated with a setting of the graphical input mechanism and the predefined volatility.",

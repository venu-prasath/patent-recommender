    "abstract": "Methods for training a model for use in monitoring a health parameter in a person are disclosed. In an embodiment, a method involves monitoring a blood pressure of a person using a control blood pressure monitoring system, receiving control data that corresponds to the monitoring using the control blood pressure monitoring system, receiving stepped frequency scanning data that corresponds to radio waves that have reflected from blood in a blood vessel of the person, wherein the stepped frequency scanning data is collected through multiple receive antennas over a range of frequencies, generating training data by combining the control data with the stepped frequency scanning data in a time synchronous manner, and training a model using the training data to produce a trained model, wherein the trained model correlates stepped frequency scanning data to values that are indicative of a blood pressure of a person.",

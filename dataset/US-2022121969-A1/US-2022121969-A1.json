    "abstract": "A method, system and computer readable medium for generating a cognitive insight comprising: receiving content element data, the content element data representing a content element, the content element comprising an element of a corpus of content; performing a cognitive learning operation on the content element data, the cognitive learning operation identifying descriptive information associated with the content element; associating a cognitive attribute with the content element using the descriptive information associated with the content element.",
    "claims": "\n1. A computer-implementable method for performing a cognitive attribution operation comprising:\nreceiving content element data, the content element data representing a content element, the content element comprising an element of a corpus of content;\nperforming a cognitive learning operation on the content element data, the cognitive learning operation being performed by a cognitive inference and learning system, the cognitive inference and learning system comprising a cognitive platform, the cognitive platform comprising a cognitive graph, the cognitive graph comprising an application cognitive graph, the application cognitive graph comprising a cognitive graph associated with a cognitive application, interactions between the cognitive application and the application cognitive graph being represented as a set of nodes in the cognitive graph;\nassociating a cognitive attribute with the content element using the descriptive information associated with the content element; and,\ngenerating a cognitive insight using the attribute associated with the content element.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein:\nthe content element data comprises an image data element; and,\nthe cognitive learning operation comprising performing a computer vision operation on the content element data.\n3. The method of claim 2, wherein:\nthe computer vision operation segments portions of the image data element to provide a segmented image comprising a plurality of image segments.\n4. The method of claim 3, wherein:\nthe cognitive attribute is associated with at least one cognitive attribute class; and,\nan image segment of the plurality of image segments is associated with a corresponding cognitive attribute class.\n5. The method of claim 2, wherein:\nthe content element comprises descriptive information related to the image data element; and,\nthe cognitive learning operation comprises performing a natural language processing operation on the descriptive information related to the image data element to generate a cognitive attribute associated with the description information.\n6. The method of claim 5, wherein:\nthe cognitive attribute associated with the descriptive information is associated with at least one cognitive attribute class.\n7. A system comprising:\na processor;\na data bus coupled to the processor; and\na non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium embodying computer program code, the non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium being coupled to the data bus, the computer program code interacting with a plurality of computer operations and comprising instructions executable by the processor and configured for:\nreceiving content element data, the content element data representing a content element, the content element comprising an element of a corpus of content;\nperforming a cognitive learning operation on the content element data, the cognitive learning operation being performed by a cognitive inference and learning system, the cognitive inference and learning system comprising a cognitive platform, the cognitive platform comprising cognitive graph, the cognitive graph being derived from the plurality of data sources, the cognitive graph comprising an application cognitive graph, the application cognitive graph comprising a cognitive graph associated with a cognitive application, interactions between the cognitive application and the application cognitive graph being represented as a set of nodes in the cognitive graph;\nassociating a cognitive attribute with the content element using the descriptive information associated with the content element; and,\ngenerating a cognitive insight using the attribute associated with the content element.\n8. The system of claim 7, wherein:\nthe content element data comprises an image data element; and,\nthe cognitive learning operation comprising performing a computer vision operation on the content element data.\n9. The system of claim 8, wherein:\nthe computer vision operation segments portions of the image data element to provide a segmented image comprising a plurality of image segments.\n10. The system of claim 9, wherein:\nthe cognitive attribute is associated with at least one cognitive attribute class; and,\nan image segment of the plurality of image segments is associated with a corresponding cognitive attribute class.\n11. The system of claim 8, wherein:\nthe content element comprises descriptive information related to the image data element; and,\nthe cognitive learning operation comprises performing a natural language processing operation on the descriptive information related to the image data element to generate a cognitive attribute associated with the description information.\n12. The system of claim 11, wherein:\nthe cognitive attribute associated with the descriptive information is associated with at least one cognitive attribute class.\n13. A non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium embodying computer program code, the computer program code comprising computer executable instructions configured for:\nreceiving content element data, the content element data representing a content element, the content element comprising an element of a corpus of content;\nperforming a cognitive learning operation on the content element data, the cognitive learning operation being performed by a cognitive inference and learning system, the cognitive inference and learning system comprising a cognitive platform, the cognitive platform comprising a cognitive graph, the cognitive graph comprising an application cognitive graph, the application cognitive graph comprising a cognitive graph associated with a cognitive application, interactions between the cognitive application and the application cognitive graph being represented as a set of nodes in the cognitive graph;\nassociating a cognitive attribute with the content element using the descriptive information associated with the content element; and,\ngenerating a cognitive insight using the attribute associated with the content element.\n14. The non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein:\nthe content element data comprises an image data element; and,\nthe cognitive learning operation comprising performing a computer vision operation on the content element data.\n15. The non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium of claim 14, wherein:\nthe computer vision operation segments portions of the image data element to provide a segmented image comprising a plurality of image segments.\n16. The non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein:\nthe cognitive attribute is associated with at least one cognitive attribute class; and,\nan image segment of the plurality of image segments is associated with a corresponding cognitive attribute class.\n17. The non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium of claim 14, wherein:\nthe content element comprises descriptive information related to the image data element; and,\nthe cognitive learning operation comprises performing a natural language processing operation on the descriptive information related to the image data element to generate a cognitive attribute associated with the description information.\n18. The non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein:\nthe cognitive attribute associated with the descriptive information is associated with at least one cognitive attribute class.\n19. The non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein the computer executable instructions are deployable to a client system from a server system at a remote location.\n20. The non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein the computer executable instructions are provided by a service provider to a user on an on-demand basis.",

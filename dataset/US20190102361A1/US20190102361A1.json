    "title": "Automatically detecting and managing anomalies in statistical models",
    "abstract": "The disclosed embodiments provide a system for managing the execution of a statistical model. During operation, the system tracks a distribution of one or more metrics related to a performance of a first version of a statistical model. When a deviation in the distribution is detected, the system outputs an alert of an anomaly in the performance of the statistical model. The system also triggers a rollback to a second version of the statistical model.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method, comprising:\ntracking, by a computer system, a distribution of one or more metrics related to a performance of a first version of a statistical model; and\ndetermining a change in a performance of the first version of the statistical model based on a deviation in the distribution;\nresponsive to determining the change in the performance of the current version, selecting a second version of the statistical model from a set of additional versions of the statistical model; and\ntriggering a rollback to the second version of the statistical model.\n2. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nafter the rollback is performed, tracking an additional distribution of the one or more metrics related to the performance of the second version of the statistical model; and\nwhen the additional distribution indicates degradation in the performance of the first previous version, triggering an additional rollback to a third version of the statistical model.\n3. The method of claim 2, further comprising:\noutputting an alert of the rollback, the additional rollback, and the performance of the first and second versions of the statistical model.\n4. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nselecting the second version of the statistical model based on a historical performance of the second version.\n5. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nafter the deviation in the distribution is detected, testing the performance of a set of previous versions of the statistical model; and\nselecting the second version of the statistical model to have a best performance among the set of previous versions.\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein tracking the distribution of the one or more metrics comprises:\naggregating the one or more metrics into a time series; and\nanalyzing one or more characteristics of the time series.\n7. The method of claim 6, wherein the time series comprises at least one of:\na mean;\na variance;\na percentile;\na count; and\na sum.\n8. The method of claim 6, wherein the one or more characteristics of the time series comprise at least one of:\na trend component;\na seasonal component;\na cyclical component; and\nan irregular component.\n9. The method of claim 1, wherein the deviation in the distribution comprises at least one of:\na mean shift;\na variance change;\na trend change; and\nan outlier.\n10. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\ntriggering a retraining of the first version of the statistical model after the deviation in the distribution is detected; and\nafter the retraining is complete, redeploying the first version of the statistical model.\n11. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more metrics comprises an observed/expected (O/E) ratio.\n12. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more metrics comprises a score distribution.\n13. An apparatus, comprising:\none or more processors; and\nmemory storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the apparatus to:\ntrack a distribution of one or more metrics related to a performance of a first version of a statistical model;\ndetermine a change in a performance of the first version of the statistical model based on a deviation in the distribution;\nresponsive to determining the change in the performance of the current version, selecting a second version of the statistical model from a set of additional versions of the statistical model; and\ntriggering a rollback to a second version of the statistical model.\n14. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein the memory further stores instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, further cause the apparatus to:\nafter the rollback is performed, track an additional distribution of the one or more metrics related to the performance of the second version of the statistical model; and\nwhen the additional distribution indicates degradation in the performance of the first previous version, trigger an additional rollback to a third version of the statistical model.\n15. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein the memory further stores instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, further cause the apparatus to:\nselect the second version of the statistical model based on a historical performance of the second version.\n16. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein the memory further stores instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, further cause the apparatus to:\nafter the deviation in the distribution is detected, test the performance of a set of previous versions of the statistical model; and\nselect the second version of the statistical model to have a best performance among the set of previous versions.\n17. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein tracking the distribution of the one or more metrics comprises:\naggregating the one or more metrics into a time series; and\nanalyzing one or more characteristics of the time series.\n18. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein the memory further stores instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, further cause the apparatus to:\ntrigger a retraining of the first version of the statistical model after the deviation in the distribution is detected; and\nafter the retraining is complete, redeploy the first version of the statistical model.\n19. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that when executed by a computer cause the computer to perform a method, the method comprising:\ntracking a distribution of one or more metrics related to a performance of a first version of a statistical model; and\ndetermining a change in a performance of the first version of the statistical model based on a deviation in the distribution;\nresponsive to determining the change in the performance of the current version, selecting a second version of the statistical model from a set of additional versions of the statistical model; and\ntriggering a rollback to the second version of the statistical model.\n20. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 19, the method further comprising:\ntriggering a retraining of the first version of the statistical model after the deviation in the distribution is detected; and\nafter the retraining is complete, redeploying the first version of the statistical model.",

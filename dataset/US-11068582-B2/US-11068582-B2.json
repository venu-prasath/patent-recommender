    "abstract": "A method executed by a processor may include storing account activity data in a database which identifies prior account activities performed by customers in their respective accounts associated with a financial institution. The database may be accessible only by computing systems of the financial institution. A set of challenge questions may be received for authenticating customers to perform high-risk activities in their respective accounts that are based on prior account activities. A machine learning model may be used to determine an authentication score used for ranking each challenge question in the set of challenge questions. An electronic request may be received from an unverified customer who desires to perform high-risk activities in an account. Challenge questions may be selected based on the ranking. The unverified customer may be verified when correctly answering the selected challenge questions. The verified customer may be allowed to perform high-risk activities in the account.",

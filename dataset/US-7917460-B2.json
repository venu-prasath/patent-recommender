    "abstract": "Systems and methods are provided for generating a decision network from text. An information extraction component extracts a quantum of evidence and an associated confidence value from a given text segment. An evidence classifier associates each quantum of evidence with one of a plurality of hypotheses. A fusion engine builds a decision network from the plurality of hypotheses, an associated base structure, the extracted quanta of evidence, and the confidence values.",

The system of claim 1, further comprising a link analysis component configured to determine link confidence values for the plurality of hypotheses from their associated hedge words for each of the one or more text segments, the fusion engine being configured to utilize the link confidence values in assembling the decision network.\n3. The system of claim 1, further comprising a scanner configured to convert paper documents into text, wherein the given computer readable text document of the plurality of computer readable text documents is an optical character recognition conversion of a paper document.\n4. The system of claim 1, further comprising a case based reasoning component configured to update the decision network based on previous successful decision networks stored in an associated knowledge base.\n5. The system of claim 1, the knowledge base comprising a weighted graph wherein each of the plurality of hypotheses are represented by a node within the graph, and the nodes are connected by weighted links representing logical relationships between the hypotheses.\n6. The system of claim 5, the plurality of hypotheses having respective associated sets of key words, and the evidence classifier including a semantic distance classifier that matches words within the one or more text segments to the respective sets of key words associated with the plurality of hypotheses, the semantic classifier determining a hypothesis for the one or more text segments according to a distribution of the words in the one or more text segments among the respective sets of key words associated with the plurality of hypotheses.\n7. The system of claim 6, wherein the occurrence of a key word from a set of key words associated with a given hypothesis within the one or more text segments represents a point associated with that hypothesis on the weighted graph, the selected hypothesis being selected as a weighted mean position of a plurality of points.\n8. The system of claim 6, wherein the selected hypothesis is the hypothesis having a largest number of occurrences of key words from its associated set of key words within the one or more text segments.\n9. The system of claim 1, wherein the confidence values are assigned according to a set of predefined confidence values, the predefined confidence values are based on a representation of human perception of the confidence expressed by each of a plurality of recognized hedge words and qualifying words.\n10. The system of claim 1, the decision network being a Dempster-Shafer belief network.\n11. The system of claim 1, the user interface being operative to allow a user to modify node parameters within the decision network, the fusion engine back propagating the modified node parameters through the decision network.\n12. A computer readable medium, having computer executable components, for generating a decision network from text, the computer readable medium comprising:\na preprocessing component that retrieves a computer readable text document from a memory and produces at least one text segment based on the computer readable text document;\nan information extraction component that identifies hedge words and qualifying words in the at least one text segment relating to one or more words in the at least one text segment, the one or more words comprising at least one of a noun, a pronoun and a verb in the at least one text segment, the information extraction component assigning confidence values to each of the identified hedge words and qualifying words representing a degree of belief or disbelief for the related one or more words to generate an associated evidence template within a knowledge base;\nan evidence classifier that assigns a given evidence template to one of a plurality of hypotheses;\na link analysis component configured to execute a data mining routine within the knowledge base to determine relationships between the plurality of hypotheses according to their associated evidence templates;\na fusion engine that constructs a decision network from the plurality of hypotheses that define nodes in the decision network, their associated evidence templates, the determined relationships between hypotheses, and an associated predefined hierarchical base structure of the hypotheses represented as nodes in the decision network;\na knowledge base that stores information relating to the plurality of hypotheses, the evidence classifier being operative to add a new hypothesis to the knowledge base in response to identification of hedge words and qualifying words in the one or more text segments; and\na user interface that displays the constructed decision network to a user.\n13. The computer readable medium of claim 12, wherein a given evidence template has a plurality of fields, and the evidence classifier comprising a rule-based classifier that classifies the evidence template according to the presence of key words in at least one field of interest among the plurality of fields.\n14. The computer readable medium of claim 12, wherein the computer readable text document comprises one of an e-mail message, an optical character recognition conversion of a paper document, a text report and a transcribed conversation.\n15. The computer readable medium of claim 12, wherein the link analysis identifies a co-occurrence of key words and phrases in each of the associated evidence templates to determine initial strength values and/or weights of links between the plurality of hypotheses.\n16. A method for generating a decision network from a plurality of computer readable text documents, comprising:\nretrieving a given computer readable text document of the plurality of computer readable text documents from a memory of a computer system;\nreducing the given computer readable text document of the plurality of computer readable text documents into one or more text segments, the one or more text segments being stored in the memory;\nforming an evidence template in the memory for each of the one or more text segments, the forming comprising:\nidentifying hedge words and qualifying words in the at least one text segment that relate to one or more words in the text segment, the one or more words comprising at least one of a noun, a pronoun and a verb; and\nassigning a confidence value to each identified hedge word and qualifying word in the at least one text segment, wherein each confidence value represents a degree of belief or disbelief for the one or more words related to each identified hedge word and qualifying word; and\nassigning each evidence template in the memory to one of a plurality of hypotheses stored in the memory by employing at least one classification technique, wherein each of the hypotheses are configured to define nodes in a given decision network\ngenerating a decision network from each evidence template and the plurality of hypotheses, such that each of the plurality hypotheses represent nodes in the decision network, wherein the decision network is stored in the memory;\nadding an additional hypothesis to the decision network that represents an additional node of the decision network, the additional hypothesis being associated with a previously generated decision network; and\ndisplaying the generated decision network to a user.\n17.

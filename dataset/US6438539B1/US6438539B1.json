    "title": "Method for retrieving data from an information network through linking search criteria to search strategy",
    "abstract": "A user of an information network is provided with information contained within at least one of plurality of network sites in view of a user search criteria by searching a database that is populated with a plurality of other search criteria provided by other network users and a plurality of search strategies. Each of the search strategies includes information regarding network sites likely to contain information relevant to the other search criteria. The other search criteria within the database are linked with the search strategies. At least one search strategy is selected from the database based upon the user's search criteria. The search strategy is executed and the results are provided to the user in one embodiment, users can employ software agents to assist in searching, collecting, and reporting on data in accordance with the user's specified criteria.",

    "abstract": "Elastic message tracking apparatus and methods are provided that opportunistically improve on the latency of a message processing system and increase the accuracy of a consolidated message stream generated from message streams received from multiple message sources. The elastic message tracking apparatus and methods reduce that latency in situations where the actual latency of all the message streams is lower than a predetermined latency value.",

    "abstract": "An artificial intelligence assistant (\u201cchatbot\u201d) operates within a multi-tenant database and allows users to interact with the underlying structured database through a natural language interface without using a standard structured query language or database interface. Users may interact with the chatbot via a chatroom and perform database queries using natural language expressions in the same manner as asking a person to perform the tasks. In addition, the chatbot may check user permissions and security parameters to determine if the user is permitted to access or alter data within the multi-tenant database.",

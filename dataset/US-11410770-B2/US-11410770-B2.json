    "abstract": "A medical scan diagnosing system is operable to receive a medical scan. Diagnosis data of the medical scan is generated by performing a medical scan inference function on the medical scan. The first medical scan is transmitted to a first client device associated with a user of the medical scan diagnosing system in response to the diagnosis data indicating that the medical scan corresponds to a non-normal diagnosis. The medical scan is displayed to the user via an interactive interface displayed by a display device corresponding to the first client device. Review data is received from the first client device, where the review data is generated by the first client device in response to a prompt via the interactive interface. Updated diagnosis data is generated based on the review data. The updated diagnosis data is transmitted to a second client device associated with a requesting entity.",

    "abstract": "An object oriented rule-based system and method that combines rule-based technology and object-oriented programming in order to provide an efficient approach for adding decision-making and inferencing capabilities to different applications. The rule-based system can include a RETE match algorithm, which can be modified to support pure object-based variable pattern matching. The LHS of a rule base can be compiled into several condition patterns, which includes a transformer integer array in order to record object variables positions. A RETE node can propagate tokens smoothly by asserting the object variable based on inheritance type hierarchy and the rules can be fired when the conditions are satisfied. The object oriented rule system can be utilized to add or remove rules at run time.",

    "abstract": "A system trains a predictive model based on training data including records of non-public healthcare insurance claims and public healthcare fee schedule data. The system determines a multiplier for each of multiple healthcare facilities based on the predictive model. The system then receives, from a consumer device, a query for a particular cost estimate of a healthcare service provided by the multiple healthcare facilities. The query includes constraints for a preferred geographic region or a preferred insurer. The system predicts a first cost estimate for the healthcare service at a first healthcare facility based on a first multiplier and a second cost estimate for the healthcare service at a second healthcare facility based on second multiplier. The system then causes the consumer device to display query results including indications of the first and second cost estimates.",
    "claims": "\n1.

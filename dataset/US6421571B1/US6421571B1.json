    "claims": "\n1. A plant asset management system, comprising in combination:\n2. The plant asset management system of claim 1 further including means for synchronously expanding at least one of said plant locations in both of said two views into one or more further plant locations by actuating said at least one of said plant locations in either one of said two views.\n3. The plant asset management system of claim 2 wherein said plant locations are comprised of object assets, instrument assets and knowledge assets.\n4. A plant asset management system, comprising in combination:\n5. The plant asset management system of claim 4 wherein said linking means includes a first object that receives navigation commands from a second object and transmits navigation commands to a third object for synchronously linking said first view with said second view so that said selection by said selection device of said one of said plurality of plant assets in either one of said first and second views results in said simultaneous display of said hierarchical first view of plant assets including said selected plant asset in said first window and said corresponding two or three dimensional second view modeling at least said selected plant asset in said second window.\n6. The plant asset management system of claim 4 further including a fourth view of said graphical user interface that is synchronously linked with said first view for displaying a bargraph view graphically displaying a plurality of bargraphs wherein at least one of said bargraphs is representative of the status of said selected plant asset.\n7. The plant asset management system of claim 4 further including a fourth view of said graphical user interface that is synchronously linked with said first view for displaying a trend plot of at least said selected plant asset.\n8. The plant asset management system of claim 4 wherein said processed asset data of at least said selected plant asset is displayed as one or more graphical plots in said third view of said graphical user interface.\n9. A method of managing plant assets, the step including:\n10. A plant asset management system, comprising in combination:\n11. The plant asset management system of claim 10 further including means for defining severity levels for said alarm parameters and means for associating different colors to different severity levels such that said color highlighted plant asset objects associated with said at least one of said plant assets in alarm are color coded based on said defined severity levels for said alarm parameters.\n12. The plant asset management system of claim 10 further including means for defining a plurality of different setpoint values and for defining severity levels for each of said plurality of different setpoint values.\n13. The plant asset management system of claim 12 further including means for defining a particular color to each of said plurality of different severity levels.\n14. The plant asset management system of claim 13 further including means for applying said plurality of different setpoint values to said asset data for determining if any asset data exceeds said plurality of different setpoint values and further including means for providing visual feedback to said user via said graphical user interface that is correlative to each of said severity levels colors for asset data exceeding each of said plurality of setpoint values.\n15. A plant asset management system, comprising in combination:\n16. The plant asset management system of claim 13 wherein said plurality of data sets are graphical plots of said accessed data.\n17. The plant asset management system of claim 15 wherein said first parameter and said second parameter are sample parameters.\n18. The plant asset management system of claim 15 wherein said first parameter and said second parameter are time parameters.\n19. The plant asset management system of claim 15 wherein said first parameter and said second parameter are RPM parameters.\n20. A plant asset management system, comprising in combination:\n21. The plant asset management system of claim 20 further including means for displaying a graphical map of said plot sessions and plots therein in a second window view on said graphical user interface simultaneously with displaying said plurality of plant asset objects in said first widow view.\n22. The plant asset management system of claim 20 wherein said first graphical plot includes a plurality of individual plots defining a plot group.\n23. The plant asset management system of claim 20 wherein at least one of said subsequent graphical plots include a plurality of individual plots for defining a plot group.\n24. The plant asset management system of claim 20 wherein said first graphical plot and at least one of said subsequent graphical plots include a plurality of individual plots for defining a plurality of plot groups.\n25. A method of managing plant assets, the steps including:\n26. A plant asset management system, comprising in combination:",

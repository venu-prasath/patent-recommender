    "abstract": "Disclosed methods and systems crowdsource quality assurance testing and error detection for user experience pages of a tax return preparation system, according to one embodiment. Testing and debugging combinations and sequences user experience pages can be time consuming and costly, and crowdsourcing error detection can reduce the length of time typically consumed in detecting all errors in a user experience flow, according to one embodiment. The methods and system include monitoring users' navigation behavior (e.g., system access data) within one or more user experience pages, using predictive models to detect when users are experiencing a potential issue, and providing issue resolution content to both help the users and characterize the potential issue, according to one embodiment. If the potential issue is an error, the methods and systems include requesting more information about the error, to facilitate resolving the error for current and subsequent users, according to one embodiment.",

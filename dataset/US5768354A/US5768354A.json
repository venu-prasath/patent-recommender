    "title": "Fraud evaluation and reporting system and method thereof",
    "abstract": "Upon receipt of a billing detail record from either an operator or automatic console, a host receiver of the fraud evaluation and reporting system of the instant invention would route a record to either a bad billed number module, a call intercept module or a fraud filter module. Depending on where the record is routed, a determination is made on whether the account number is bad or whether the account number is being used by a fraudulent user. Moreover, calls may be intercepted to determine whether specific predefined thresholds have been exceeded and whether or not subsequent calls are to be processed or denied. Furthermore, by means of the fraud filter processes, various alerts may be generated by applying thresholds relating to different products and division with the account number.",

System of claim 1, wherein said plurality of originating number store means are divided into even and odd stores into which respective even and odd numbers are stored, respectively, each of said second store means associating the originating numbers stored therein or directed thereto with particular thresholds and product or service types;\nwherein said each record having an originating number is routed to one of said second store means whose product or service type corresponds to said each record so that the type of originating number of said each record can be compared with at least one of said particular thresholds related to the particular product or service.\n13. System of claim 12, wherein said thresholds comprise domestic threshold, international country threshold, and international target country threshold.\n14. System of claim 12, further comprising:\nexception store for storing a plurality of predefined origination numbers each having a corresponding threshold;\nwherein if the originating number of said each record having an originating number matches one of said predefined originating numbers, said at least one particular threshold is replaced with the threshold corresponding to the matched originating number so that the alert is provided only when the usage of the originating number of said each record matching said predefined account number exceeds said corresponding threshold.\n15.

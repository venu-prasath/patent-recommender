    "abstract": "A processor receives a signal representing data including event information detailing an event involving an entity having a registered ownership interest in a product and loads a portion of a distributed electronic ledger for tracking ownership information associated with the product. The distributed electronic ledger includes, within a block thereof and associated with the product, an event trigger list including entity data associated with each entity having a registered ownership interest in the product and a rules engine including rules associated with event triggers in the event trigger list. The processor determines whether a triggering event corresponding to the event is stored in the event trigger list and, when the event has a corresponding triggering event, determines the associated rule within the rules engine. The processor updates and saves the distributed electronic ledger by performing an action specified by the determined associated rule.",

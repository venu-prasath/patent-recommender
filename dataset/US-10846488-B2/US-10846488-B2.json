    "abstract": "A personality model is created for a population and used as an input to a text generation system. Alternative texts are created based upon the emotional effect of the generated text. Certain words or phrases are \u201cpinned\u201d in the output, reducing the variability of the generated text so as to preserve required information content, and a number of tests provide input to a discriminator network so that proposed outputs both match an outside objective regarding the information content, emotional affect, and grammatical acceptability. A feedback loop provides new \u201cground truth\u201d data points for refining the personality model and associated generated text.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method for generating natural language, the method comprising:\nbuilding a quantitative personality model of a target, by correlating known information about the target with a set of relatively mutually orthogonal personality traits, and creating a vector representation of an estimated expression of each trait in the quantitative personality model of the target;\nencoding a source text as a sequence of weights on a pre-built conditional text model;\nusing the pre-built conditional text model and the quantitative personality model to create a generated text with approximately equal semantic content but differing syntax and word choice;\nwherein the quantitative personality model is provided as an input to an encoder-decoder, and wherein the syntax and word choice of the generated text varies as a function of the estimated expression of the quantitative personality model.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein the encoder-decoder further includes an attention mechanism, wherein the attention mechanism applies a varying weight to different types of syntax and word choice depending upon the input quantitative personality model.\n3. The method of claim 1, further comprising coupling an evaluator to the encoder-decoder, the evaluator providing a personality score reflecting the association of a language use in the generated text with the quantitative personality model input to the encoder-decoder; and\nproviding the personality score to the encoder-decoder; and\nupdating a number of internal weights associated with the encoder-decoder to reinforce high personality association and to discourage lower personality association.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein building a quantitative personality model of a target includes one of a correlating differently-expressed but semantically similar information, recognizing named entities within the input, disambiguating information references, segmenting data based upon one or more characteristics, estimating one or more values, and categorizing one or more inputs.\n5. The method of claim 1, further comprising providing the generated text to a representative of a modeled prospect class and using a response of the representative to update the modeled prospect class.\n6. The method of claim 5, wherein the modeled prospect class is updated proportionally to the receptiveness of the representative to the text.\n7. The method of claim 5, wherein the modeled prospect class is updated based on an estimated measurement of one or more personality traits.\n8. A system for quantitative estimation of one or more personality traits, the system comprising:\na storage operable to store or retrieve a set of data associated with a particular target personality to be modeled;\na prospect information fusion component operable to receive a first set of data inputs associated with the particular target personality;\nan integrator correlating two or more of the data inputs having substantially similar objective semantic content and substituting a common representation for the two or more data inputs;\na disambiguator classifying the two or more of the data inputs as referring to the same or different real-world entities;\na prospect modeling component, operable to associate the set of data associated with the particular target personality with a conditional probability that one or more traits are expressed by the particular target personality from a set of relatively mutually orthogonal personality traits, resulting in a vector representation of an estimated expression of each trait in the quantitative personality model of the particular target personality;\nwherein one or more of the prospect information fusion component, the integrator, and the disambiguator is operable to do one of retrieve information from the storage, modify a representation of the set of data, and store an updated representation of the set of data in the storage; and\nwherein the system iteratively applies one or more of the prospect information fusion component, the integrator, the disambiguator, to the set of data in the storage; and\nwherein the vector representation of the estimated expression of each trait in the quantitative personality model is updated after each iteration.\n9. The system of claim 8, further comprising a segmentation component grouping data according to one or more common characteristics; and wherein the system iteratively applies the segmentation component at least once to update information in the storage.\n10. The system of claim 8, further comprising an imputation component estimating at least one unknown value and storing the estimated value;\nand wherein the system iteratively applies the imputation component at least once to update information in the storage.\n11. The system of claim 8, wherein one or more of the inputs provided to the prospect information fusion component includes a confidence representation, wherein the confidence representation represents a conditional probability that the input is representative of the particular target personality.\n12. The system of claim 11, wherein the system further includes an information update component that receives a second set of inputs associated with the particular target personality to be modeled.\n13. The system of claim 8, further including a classifier separating one or more elements in the set of data into objective and subjective classifications, wherein the prospect information fusion component stores objective and subjective information differently.\n14. The system of claim 8, wherein the integrator includes a named entity recognition component.\n15. The system of claim 8, wherein the particular target personality is a single identified person.\n16. The system of claim 8, wherein the particular target personality is representative of a class of persons sharing one or more similar characteristics according to the quantitative personality model.\n17. The system of claim 16, wherein the quantitative personality model representative of a class of persons is used to provide initial estimates for the values in a second quantitative personality model representative of a single identified person.",

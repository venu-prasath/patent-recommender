    "abstract": "Systems, methods, tangible non-transitory computer-readable media, and devices for associating objects are provided. For example, the disclosed technology can receive sensor data associated with the detection of objects over time. An association dataset can be generated and can include information associated with object detections of the objects at a most recent time interval and object tracks of the objects at time intervals in the past. A subset of the association dataset including the object detections that satisfy some association subset criteria can be determined. Association scores for the object detections in the subset of the association dataset can be determined. Further, the object detections can be associated with the object tracks based on the association scores for each of the object detections in the subset of the association dataset that satisfy some association criteria.",

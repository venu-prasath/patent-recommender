    "title": "Predictive bandwidth allocation method and apparatus",
    "abstract": "Allocation of telecommunication systems bandwidth is provided preferably in a predictive fashion. Packets are identified with particular data streams and characteristics of the data streams are used to predict probable future bandwidth requirements. Such predictions are used to allocate high-bandwidth channels, such as ISDN B channels and to close or switch channels as in accordance with predicted needs. Preferably the system is self-learning and can modify a rules base for making allocation decisions e.g. based on actual use statistics.",

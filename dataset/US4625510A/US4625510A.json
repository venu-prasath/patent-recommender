    "title": "Stress limiter apparatus for a gas turbine engine",
    "abstract": "A stress limiter apparatus for a gas turbine engine (10) is disclosed. A proportional fuel fuel control (11) regulates the fuel flow (Wf) from a hydromechanical unit (36) based upon an error signal (E) representing the difference between a demanded speed signal (Nd) and an actual speed signal (N1). The demanded speed signal (Nd) is generated by an integrator (32) as the time integral of one of the acceleration terms (A1, A2, A3) selected by gate 38. The demanded acceleration term (A1) is generated by junction (26) as the difference between the demanded signal (Nd) and a scheduled speed signal (Ngs). The acceleration terms (A2, A3) are generated by junctions (44, 46) and scheduling means (40, 42) which form stress limiter circuits.",

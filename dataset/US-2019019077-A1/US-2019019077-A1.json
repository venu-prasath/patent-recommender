    "abstract": "The present technology is an automatically configuring virtual assistant. The virtual assistant is assigned to an existing conversation space and, based on analyzing the existing conversation space the virtual assistant has been assigned to, is associated with at least one contextual cue of an existing conversation space. The analysis includes natural language processing of a title, a topic, or a past conversation of the existing conversation space in order to determine the at least one contextual cue.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method of automatically configuring a virtual assistant comprising:\nreceiving an assignment of the first virtual assistant to an existing conversation space, wherein the assignment includes the first virtual assistant as a participant in the existing conversation space;\nanalyzing the existing conversation space to determine at least one contextual cue of the existing conversation space, wherein the analyzing includes natural language processing of a title, a topic, or a past conversation of the existing conversation space; and\nassociating the first virtual assistant with the at least one contextual cue.\n2. The method of claim 1, comprising:\nreceiving a request for assistance with a topic;\ndetermining that the topic relates to the at least one contextual cue associated with the first virtual assistant; and\nsending the topic to the first virtual assistant for submission to the conversation space by the first virtual assistant.\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein the first virtual assistant is assigned to multiple existing conversation spaces, each existing conversation space associated with a functional chat room comprised of expert participants.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein the first virtual assistant analyzes the existing conversation space by using natural language understanding to parse at least a portion of past content of the existing conversation space.\n5. The method of claim 4, wherein the first virtual assistant parses the past content to determine the topic and intent associated with the existing conversation space.\n6. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nparsing, periodically, a portion of past content of the existing conversation space;\nbased on the periodic parsing, determining a trend in at least one of the topic or intent of the existing conversation space; and\nupdating the at least one contextual cue associated with the first virtual assistant.\n7. The method of claim 1, wherein analyzing the existing conversation space comprises a machine learning based decisional system that generates one or more statistical models of the existing conversation space.\n8. A system comprising:\na plurality of virtual assistants, each of the plurality of virtual assistants being assigned to a respective existing conversation space, wherein each of the plurality of virtual assistants analyzing the respective existing conversation space to which it is assigned to determine at least one contextual cue of the respective existing conversation space, wherein the analyzing includes natural language processing of a title, a topic, or a past conversation of the respective existing conversation space;\na contextual cue database storing an association between the plurality of virtual assistants and the at least one contextual queue of the respective existing conversation space to which it is assigned; and\na chatbot configured to interface with a user to receive a query, and determine one of the plurality of virtual assistants associated with the at least one contextual cue that is relevant to the query, and to send the query to the determined one of the plurality of virtual assistants,\nwherein the one of the plurality of virtual assistants is configured to receive the query from the chatbot and to post the query in the respective existing conversation space to which the one of the plurality of virtual assistants is assigned,\nwherein the one of the plurality of virtual assistants is configured to receive a reply in the respective existing conversation space to which the one of the plurality of virtual assistants is assigned, and to provide the reply to the chatbot to be communicated to the user.\n9. The system of claim 8, wherein the one of the plurality of virtual assistants is assigned to multiple existing conversation spaces, each existing conversation space associated with a functional chat room comprised of expert participants.\n10. The system of claim 8, wherein the one of the plurality of virtual assistants analyzes the existing conversation space by using natural language understanding to parse at least a portion of past content of the existing conversation space.\n11. The system of claim 10, wherein the one of the plurality of virtual assistants parses the past content to determine the topic and intent associated with the existing conversation space.\n12. The system of claim 8, wherein the one of the plurality of virtual assistants is configured to:\nparse, periodically, a portion of past content of the existing conversation space;\nbased on the periodic parsing, determine a trend in at least one of the topic or intent of the existing conversation space; and\nupdate the at least one contextual cue associated with the first virtual assistant.\n13. The system of claim 12, the one of the plurality of virtual assistants further configured to:\ndetermine that the trend is based on a topic that is repeated over a threshold number of times; and\nbased on the trend determined, flag the topic as a help article topic.\n14. The system of claim 12, the one of the plurality of virtual assistants further configured to:\ndetermine that the trend is based on a topic that is repeated over a threshold number of times; and\nbased on the trend determined, provide the reply to the chatbot without posting the topic in the respective existing conversation space.\n15. A computer program product residing on a non-transitory computer readable storage medium having a plurality of instructions stored thereon, which when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform operations comprising:\nreceiving an assignment of the first virtual assistant to an existing conversation space, wherein the assignment includes the first virtual assistant as a participant in the existing conversation space;\nanalyzing the existing conversation space to determine at least one contextual cue of the existing conversation space, wherein the analyzing includes natural language processing of a title, a topic, or a past conversation of the existing conversation space; and\nassociating the first virtual assistant with the at least one contextual cue.\n16. The computer program product of claim 15, further comprising:\nreceiving a request for assistance with a topic;\ndetermining that the topic relates to the at least one contextual cue associated with the first virtual assistant; and\nsending the topic to the first virtual assistant for submission to the conversation space by the first virtual assistant.\n17. The computer program product of claim 16, wherein the first virtual assistant is assigned to multiple existing conversation spaces, each existing conversation space associated with a functional chat room comprised of expert participants.\n18. The computer program product of claim 16, wherein the first virtual assistant analyzes the existing conversation space by using natural language understanding to parse at least a portion of past content of the existing conversation space.\n19. The computer program product of claim 18, wherein the first virtual assistant parses the past content to determine the topic and intent associated with the existing conversation space.\n20. The computer program product of claim 16, further comprising:\nparsing, periodically, a portion of past content of the existing conversation space;\nbased on the periodic parsing, determining a trend in at least one of the topic or intent of the existing conversation space; and\nupdating the at least one contextual cue associated with the first virtual assistant.\n21. The computer program product of claim 20, further comprising:\ndetermining that the trend is based on a topic that is repeated over a threshold number of times; and\nbased on the trend determined, flagging the topic as a help article topic."

    "abstract": "A system includes a plurality of RFID chips affixed to a catheter, a data collection engine device, and a server device. The data collection engine wirelessly transmits power to a first one of the RFID chips and receives first medical data from the first RFID chip while the first RFID chip is activated by the power receiver. The data collection engine generates a first message indicative of the first medical data to be sent to the server device. The server device can determine aspects of the catheter such as position and risk states based upon the first medical data.",

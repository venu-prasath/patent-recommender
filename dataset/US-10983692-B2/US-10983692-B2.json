    "abstract": "In accordance with some embodiments, a computer-implemented method for use in conjunction with a device with a touch screen display is disclosed. In the method, a movement of an object on or near the touch screen display is detected. In response to detecting the movement, an electronic document displayed on the touch screen display is translated in a first direction. If an edge of the electronic document is reached while translating the electronic document in the first direction while the object is still detected on or near the touch screen display, an area beyond the edge of the document is displayed. After the object is no longer detected on or near the touch screen display, the document is translated in a second direction until the area beyond the edge of the document is no longer displayed.",
    "claims": "\n1. An electronic device, comprising:\na touch screen display;\none or more processors;\nmemory; and\none or more programs, wherein the one or more programs are stored in the memory and configured to be executed by the one or more processors, the one or more programs including instructions for:\ndisplaying one or more of a series of items in a list;\ndetecting a movement of an object on the touch screen display;\nin response to detecting the movement, translating the displayed one or more items in a first direction;\nin response to continuing to detect movement of the object on the touch screen display after a terminus of the list has been reached, displaying an indication that the terminus of the list has been reached; and\nin response to detecting that the object is no longer in contact with the touch screen display, ceasing to display the indication.\n2. The electronic device of claim 1, wherein the one or more programs further include instructions for: in response to detecting that the object is no longer in contact with the touch screen display, translating the one or more items in a second direction.\n3.

The electronic device of claim 1, wherein a direction of movement of the object corresponds to the translation of the one or more items in the first direction.\n5. The electronic device of claim 1, wherein the object is a finger.\n6. The electronic device of claim 1, wherein the first direction is a vertical direction, a horizontal direction, or a diagonal direction.\n7. The electronic device of claim 2, wherein the second direction is opposite the first direction.\n8. The electronic device of claim 1, wherein translating in the first direction prior to reaching the terminus of the list has an associated speed of translation that corresponds to a speed of movement.\n9. The electronic device of claim 1, wherein translating in the first direction is in accordance with a simulation of an equation of motion having friction.\n10. The electronic device of claim 2, wherein translating the one or more items in the second direction is a damped motion.\n11. The electronic device of claim 1, wherein displaying the indication comprises displaying an area beyond the terminus of the list.\n12. The electronic device of claim 11, wherein the area beyond the terminus of the list is black, gray, a solid color, or white.\n13. The electronic device of claim 2, wherein changing from translating in the first direction to translating in the second direction makes the terminus of the list appear to be elastically attached to an edge of the touch screen display or to an edge displayed on the touch screen display.\n14. The electronic device of claim 1, wherein the indication that the terminus of the list has been reached is an indication that movement of the object on the touch screen display continues to be detected after the terminus of the list has been reached.\n15. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing one or more programs configured to be executed by one or more processors of an electronic device with a touch screen display, the one or more programs including instructions for:\ndisplaying one or more of a series of items in a list;\n16. A method, comprising:\nat an electronic device having a touch screen display:\ndisplaying one or more of a series of items in a list;\ndetecting a movement of an object on the touch screen display;\nin response to detecting the movement, translating the displayed one or more items in a first direction;\nin response to continuing to detect movement of the object on the touch screen display after a terminus of the list has been reached, displaying an indication that the terminus of the list has been reached; and\nin response to detecting that the object is no longer in contact with the touch screen display, ceasing to display the indication.\n17. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the one or more programs further include instructions for: in response to detecting that the object is no longer in contact with the touch screen display, translating the one or more items in a second direction.\n18. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein displaying the indication includes displaying a colored indication visually distinct from the one or more items.\n19. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein a direction of movement of the object corresponds to the translation of the one or more items in the first direction.\n20. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the object is a finger.\n21. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the first direction is a vertical direction, a horizontal direction, or a diagonal direction.\n22. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein the second direction is opposite the first direction.\n23. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein translating in the first direction prior to reaching the terminus of the list has an associated speed of translation that corresponds to a speed of movement.\n24. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein translating in the first direction is in accordance with a simulation of an equation of motion having friction.\n25. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein translating the one or more items in the second direction is a damped motion.\n26. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein displaying the indication comprises displaying an area beyond the terminus of the list.\n27. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 26, wherein the area beyond the terminus of the list is black, gray, a solid color, or white.\n28. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein changing from translating in the first direction to translating in the second direction makes the terminus of the list appear to be elastically attached to an edge of the touch screen display or to an edge displayed on the touch screen display.\n29. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the indication that the terminus of the list has been reached is an indication that movement of the object on the touch screen display continues to be detected after the terminus of the list has been reached.\n30. The method of claim 16, further comprising in response to detecting that the object is no longer in contact with the touch screen display, translating the one or more items in a second direction.\n31. The method of claim 16, wherein displaying the indication includes displaying a colored indication visually distinct from the one or more items.\n32. The method of claim 16, wherein a direction of movement of the object corresponds to the translation of the one or more items in the first direction.\n33. The method of claim 16, wherein the object is a finger.\n34. The method of claim 16, wherein the first direction is a vertical direction, a horizontal direction, or a diagonal direction.\n35.

    "title": "Pattern recognition method and apparatus",
    "abstract": "A general purpose pattern recognition method and apparatus comprises a hierarchical network of basic recognizers, each basic recognizer being capable of discriminating a particular feature at a lower level and providing outputs for higher levels of abstraction. In a learning mode, a series of sample patterns having a feature are presented as input along with several near-miss patterns. The pattern recognition apparatus learns to recognize the feature by keeping track of which basic recognizers detect patterns containing the feature. In a recognition mode, the invention determines if a presented pattern has the feature by polling the basic recognizers. A summation algorithm calculates the likelihood that the presented pattern has a particular feature.",

    "abstract": "A surgical stapling system comprising a shaft, an end effector, an unspent staple cartridge including staples, an articulation joint, a drive system, a control system, a drive member, a locking system, and a rotatable member is disclosed. The end effector comprises a first iaw and a second iaw movable relative to the first iaw. The drive system is configured to generate a low actuation rate rotary motion during a first operating mode and a high actuation rate rotary motion during a second operating mode. The control system comprises a user interface configured to allow a user to selectively switch between the first and second operating modes. The locking system prevents the advancement of the drive member if the unspent staple cartridge is not correctly seated in the end effector. The rotatable member is operably coupled with the drive system and is in operable engagement with the drive member.",
    "claims": "\n1. A surgical stapling system, comprising:\na shaft;\nan end effector, comprising:\na first jaw; and\na second jaw movable relative to said first jaw between an open position and a clamped position;\nan unspent staple cartridge comprising staples removably stored therein;\nan articulation joint disposed proximal to said end effector, wherein said end effector is rotatable relative to said shaft about said articulation joint;\na drive system configured to generate a low actuation rate rotary motion during a first operating mode and a high actuation rate rotary motion during a second operating mode;\na control system configured to switch between said first operating mode and said second operating mode, wherein said control system comprises a user interface configured to allow a user to selectively switch between said first operating mode and said second operating mode;\na drive member;\na locking system which prevents the advancement of said drive member if said unspent staple cartridge is not correctly seated in said end effector; and\na rotatable member operably coupled with said drive system, wherein said rotatable member is in operable engagement with said drive member, wherein said low actuation rate rotary motion from said drive system moves said drive member at a first rate, and wherein said high actuation rate rotary motion from said drive system moves said drive member at a second rate.\n2. A surgical stapling system, comprising:\na surgical robot;\na shaft attached to said surgical robot;\nan end effector, comprising:\na first jaw; and\na second jaw movable relative to said first jaw between an open position and a clamped position;\nan unspent staple cartridge comprising staples removably stored therein;\nan articulation joint disposed proximal to said end effector, wherein said end effector is rotatable relative to said shaft about said articulation joint;\na drive system configured to generate a low actuation rate rotary motion during a first operating mode and a high actuation rate rotary motion during a second operating mode;\na control system configured to switch between said first operating mode and said second operating mode;\na user interface configured to allow a user to selectively switch between said first operating mode and said second operating mode;\na drive member;\na locking system which prevents the advancement of said drive member if said unspent staple cartridge is not correctly seated in said end effector; and\na rotatable member operably coupled with said drive system, wherein said rotatable member is in operable engagement with said drive member, wherein said low actuation rate rotary motion from said drive system moves said drive member at a first rate, and wherein said high actuation rate rotary motion from said drive system moves said drive member at a second rate.\n3. A surgical stapling system, comprising:\na shaft;\nan end effector, comprising:\na first jaw; and\na second jaw movable relative to said first jaw between an open position and a clamped position;\nan unspent staple cartridge comprising staples removably stored therein;\nan articulation joint disposed proximal to said end effector, wherein said end effector is rotatable relative to said shaft about said articulation joint;\na bi-modal drive system mechanically transitionable between a first operating mode and a second operating mode, wherein said bi-modal drive system is configured to generate a low actuation rate rotary motion in said first operating mode and a high actuation rate rotary motion in said second operating mode;\na control system configured to switch between said first operating mode and said second operating mode, wherein said control system comprises a user interface configured to allow a user to selectively switch between said first operating mode and said second operating mode;\na drive member;\na locking system which prevents the advancement of said drive member if said unspent staple cartridge is not correctly seated in said end effector; and\na rotatable member operably coupled with said bi-modal drive system, wherein said rotatable member is in operable engagement with said drive member, wherein said low actuation rate rotary motion from said bi-modal drive system moves said drive member at a first rate, and wherein said high actuation rate rotary motion from said bi-modal drive system moves said drive member at a second rate."

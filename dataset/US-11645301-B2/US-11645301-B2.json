    "abstract": "Methods, systems and computer program products are provided for cross-media recommendation by store a plurality of taste profiles corresponding to a first domain and a plurality of media item vectors corresponding to a second domain. An evaluation taste profile in the first domain is applied to a plurality of models that have been generated based on relationship among the plurality of taste profiles and the plurality of media item vectors, and obtain a plurality of resulting codes corresponding to at least one of the plurality of media item vectors in the second domain.",
    "claims": "\n1. A system for cross-media recommendation, comprising:\na first database operable to store a plurality of user taste profiles corresponding to a first domain;\na second database operable to store a plurality of media item vectors corresponding to a second domain; and\nat least one processor configured to:\ngenerate a plurality of weighted term vectors by multiplying, for each term in a user taste profile of the plurality of user taste profiles, an affinity by a probability that the term is associated with a media item;\ngenerate vector quantized media data by vector quantizing the plurality of media item vectors;\nmap the weighted term vectors to the vector quantized media data to form relationships between the user taste profiles and one or more media items;\ntrain a model based on the map to learn the relationships between the user taste profiles and the one or more media items; and\napply an evaluation taste profile in the first domain to the model to obtain a media item corresponding to the second domain.\n2. The system according to claim 1, wherein the first domain is music and the second domain is any one, or a combination, of books, movies, or games.\n3. The system according to claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to:\ngenerate a training set based on the plurality of user taste profiles and the plurality of media item vectors, wherein at least a portion of the training set includes ground truths across the first domain and the second domain; and\ntrain the model with the training set.\n4. The system according to claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to:\nobtain a confidence interval indicating an amount of confidence in a relation between the evaluation taste profile and the media item vector of the media item corresponding to the second domain.\n5. A computer-implemented method for cross-media recommendation, comprising:\nstoring a plurality of user taste profiles corresponding to a first domain;\nstoring a plurality of media item vectors corresponding to a second domain;\ngenerating a plurality of weighted term vectors by multiplying, for each term in a user taste profile of the plurality of user taste profiles, an affinity by a probability that the term is associated with a media item;\ngenerating vector quantized media data by vector quantizing the plurality of media item vectors;\nmapping the weighted term vectors to the vector quantized media data to form relationships between the user taste profiles and one or more media items;\ntraining a model based on the map to learn the relationships between the user taste profiles and the one or more media items; and\napplying an evaluation taste profile in the first domain to the model to obtain a media item corresponding to the second domain.\n6.

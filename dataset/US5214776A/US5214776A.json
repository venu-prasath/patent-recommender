    "title": "Multiprocessor system having global data replication",
    "abstract": "A multiprocessor system having global data replicated in all local memories, each local memory related to one of the system central processing units (CPUs), where consistency of the global data in each of the local memories is provided by a global write procedure according to which an agent CPUZ, willing to modify a global data in its own local memory, issues a write command on the system bus for performing the write operation in the local memory of another destination CPU of the system and characterizes the write command as a global write, so that all the CPUs connected to the system bus (including CPUZ) detect such command, perform such write operation in their related local memory and provide the destination CPU with a signal indicative of a performed write operation, so that the destination CPU, as \"replier\", may signal to CPUZ the successful execution of the global write. By this procedure, it is possible to use standard, commercially available system bus and interface circuits which require, for correct execution of the system bus protocol, the activation of both an \"agent\" or requesting processor and a \"replier\" or destination processor.",

    "claims": "\n1. A multiprocessor system utilizing replicated global data and comprising a plurality of central processing units (CPU) connected each to the other and intercommunicating through a system bus, to which each CPU has access as a requesting agent, each CPU comprising a related processor (MP) and a related local memory (8) connected by and intercommunicating through a local bus (11), a related output interface unit (9, 10) connecting the related CPU to said system bus and providing access to said system bus from said related CPU as a requesting agent; said local memory in each CPU storing a copy of a plurality of global data; each CPU further comprising:\nan input interface unit (40, 10) for accessing said local memory from said system bus;\nfirst logic circuits (16) for detecting an active system configuration having a plurality of active CPUs and a write operation command related to global data, said write operation command being generated, in the CPU comprising said first logic circuits, by the related processor and referencing the related local memory;\nsecond logic circuits (41) for modifying the address of said write operation command to reference a local memory space of one of said active CPUs, identified by said modified address as a destination CPU of said write operation command,\nsaid first logic circuits activating said output interface unit (9, 10) to obtain access to said system bus by the related requesting agent CPU and to transfer said write operation command and said modified address onto said system bus;\nthird logic circuits (10, 40, 21) operative in said destination CPU for recognizing said write operation command and for performing said write operation into the local memory of said destination CPU;\nfourth logic circuits (40, 33) operative in all active CPUs other than said destination CPU, said active CPUs including said requesting agent CPU, for:\na) identifying said write operation command, referencing said destination CPU, as a write command related to a global data;\nb) performing said write operation into the local memory of the CPU comprising said fourth logic circuits; and\nc) signalling to said destination CPU the posting of said write operation; and\nfifth logic circuits (39, 10) operative in said destination CPU for detecting that said write operation has been posted in all active CPUs and for providing detection consequent response signals, on said system bus, to said requesting agent CPU.\n2. A multiprocessor system according to claim 1 in which said first logic circuits are operative for detecting an unseverable read-modify-write command related to a global data, generated in the related CPU by the related processor and referencing the related local memory; said second logic circuits being operative for modifying the address of said read-modify-write command to reference a local memory space of one of said active CPUs identified by said modified address as destination CPU, said first logic circuits activating said output interface unit (9, 10) to obtain access to said system bus for the related requesting agent CPU and to transfer said read-modify-write command with said modified address on said system bus; and said third logic circuits being operative in said destination CPU for recognizing said read-modify-write command and for performing said read-modify-write operation in the local memory related to said destination CPU.",

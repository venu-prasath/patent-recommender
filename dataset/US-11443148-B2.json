    "abstract": "Systems, methods, tangible non-transitory computer-readable media, and devices for autonomous vehicle operation are provided. For example, a computing system can receive object data that includes portions of sensor data. The computing system can determine, in a first stage of a multiple stage classification using hardware components, one or more first stage characteristics of the portions of sensor data based on a first machine-learned model. In a second stage of the multiple stage classification, the computing system can determine second stage characteristics of the portions of sensor data based on a second machine-learned model. The computing system can generate an object output based on the first stage characteristics and the second stage characteristics. The object output can include indications associated with detection of objects in the portions of sensor data.",

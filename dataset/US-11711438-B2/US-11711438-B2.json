    "abstract": "Systems and methods for periodically modifying data privacy elements are provided. The systems and methods may identify a set of data privacy elements. A data privacy element can characterizes a feature of a computing device and can be detectable by a network host. A first artificial profile can be generated by modifying a first data privacy element based on an artificial profile model that defines a relationship associated with one or more constraints between the set of data privacy elements. Subsequent to generating the first artificial profile, a second artificial profile can be generated by periodically modifying a second data privacy element in accordance with the relationship defined by the artificial profile model. The computer device can be masked from being identified by the network host by sending the second artificial profile including the second data privacy element to a requested network location.",

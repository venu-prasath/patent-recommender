    "title": "Motion compensating coder employing an image coding control method",
    "abstract": "A motion compensating coder which includes a control section for setting quantizer step size accounts for both the buffer occupancy and the texture of the image being coded. The coding control method, using well-accepted assumptions relating to the human visual sensitivity to quantization distortion in an image, employs a recursive strategy that maintains a coding rate which closely approximates the number of target bits.",

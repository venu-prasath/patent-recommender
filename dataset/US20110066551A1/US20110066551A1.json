    "title": "Method and System for Providing Risk Information in Connection with Transaction Processing",
    "abstract": "A system for providing real-time risk mitigation for an authorization system. The system receives authorization requests from multiple merchants (or their respective acquirers) and processes such requests. Each processed request is then forwarded to its corresponding issuer for further authorization. Each processed request includes an authorization message. The authorization message can include a risk score, a number of reason codes, and a number of condition codes. The use of the risk score, reason codes and condition codes allows issuers to make better informed decisions with respect to providing authorizations.",

    "claims": "\n1. A hybrid transaction processing system comprising:\na communications network for clearing and settling transactions; and\nan offline platform communicatively integrated with the communications network via at least one shared data exchange standard for predictive model sharing;\nwherein the communications network is configured by at least one real-time server to:\nreceive transaction information from a merchant for authorization of a transaction between the merchant and a consumer;\napply the transaction information to a predictive model to generate risk information;\nsend the risk information and transaction information to an issuer of the consumer;\nreceive a transaction authorization decision from the issuer based on the risk information;\nsend the transaction authorization decision of the issuer to the merchant; and\nprovide profile generating information to the offline platform;\nwherein the offline platform is configured by at least one offline server to:\nreceive the profile generating information from the communications network, the profiling generating information comprising at least the risk information, transaction information, and authorization decision;\naccess historical transactional information; and\ngenerate an updated predictive model based on the profile generating information and the historical information related to past transactions using the predictive model;\nwherein the communications network is further configured to:\nreceive the updated predictive model from the offline platform;\napply the updated predictive model to a new transaction by the consumer,\nwherein the offline platform is further configured to:\ngenerate a multi-dimensional data set based on at least the historical transactional information, profile generating information, and transaction information of the merchant with a plurality of other consumer accounts, and\ngenerate a behavioral analysis regarding the merchant based on the multi-dimensional data.\n2. The hybrid transaction processing system of claim 1, wherein the offline platform is further configured to send the analysis of the multi-dimensional data set to an entity having a business arrangement with the merchant.\n3. The hybrid transaction processing system of claim 2, wherein the analysis of the multi-dimensional data set regards potential fraudulent behavior by the merchant.\n4. The hybrid transaction processing system of claim 1, wherein the profile generating information is provided to the offline platform on an ad-hoc basis according to the consumer's transactional behavior.\n5. The hybrid transaction processing system of claim 4, wherein the updated version of the predictive model is received by the communications network from the offline platform according to a predetermined schedule.\n6. The hybrid transaction processing system of claim 5, wherein the communications network is further configured to maintain a working profile of short-term transaction history of the consumer between receiving updates of the predictive model.\n7. The hybrid transaction processing system of claim 1, wherein the predictive model comprises an event profile of the consumer, wherein the event profile comprises information of transactional events performed by the consumer.\n8. The hybrid transaction processing system of claim 7, wherein the events comprise the consumer's behavior with only the merchant during a specified period of time.\n9. The hybrid transaction processing system of claim 7, wherein the events comprise tabulated information comprising location, merchant, merchant category, and time period information of the consumer.\n10. The hybrid transaction processing system of claim 1, wherein the shared data exchange standard for predictive model sharing comprises predictive model markup language (PMML).\n11. A method comprising:\nsending, from an offline platform comprising at least one offline server, a predictive model to a communications network that is communicatively integrated with the offline platform via at least one shared data exchange standard for predictive model sharing, wherein the predictive model is used by the communications network to generate real-time risk information for a transaction between a consumer and a merchant;\nreceiving profile generating information from a communications network based on the transaction completed between the consumer and the merchant, the profiling generating information comprising at least the generated real-time risk information, transaction information, and an authorization decision for the completed transaction;\naccessing historical transactional information regarding past transactions of the consumer;\ngenerating an updated predictive model based on the profile generating information and the historical information using the predictive model;\nsending the updated predictive model to the real-time communications network, wherein the real-time communications network applies the updated predictive model to a new transaction of the consumer;\ngenerating a multi-dimensional data set based on at least the historical transactional information, profile generating information, and transaction information of the merchant with a plurality of other consumer accounts; and\ngenerating a behavioral analysis regarding the merchant based on the multi-dimensional data set.\n12. The method of claim 11, further comprising:\nsending the behavioral analysis of the multi-dimensional data set to an entity having a business arrangement with the merchant.\n13. The method of claim 12, wherein the analysis of the multi-dimensional data set regards potential fraudulent behavior by the merchant.\n14. The method of claim 11, wherein sending the predictive model to the communications network and sending the updated predictive model to the real-time communications network is performed according to a predetermined schedule.\n15. The method of claim 14, wherein the profile generating information is received on an ad-hoc basis according to the consumer's transactional behavior.\n16. The method of claim 15, further comprising:\nshortening the predetermined schedule based on receiving the ad-hoc basis over a period of time with increasing frequency.\n17. The method of claim 11, wherein the predictive model comprises an event profile of the consumer, wherein the event profile comprises information of transactional events performed by the consumer.\n18. The method of claim 17, wherein the events comprise the consumer's behavior with only the merchant during a specified period of time.\n19. The method of claim 17, wherein the events comprise tabulated information comprising location, merchant, merchant category, and time period information of the consumer.\n20. The method of claim 11, wherein shared data exchange standard for predictive model sharing comprising predictive model markup language (PMML).",

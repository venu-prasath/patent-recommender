    "abstract": "Embodiments in the present disclosure relate generally to computer network architectures for machine learning, artificial intelligence, and automated insight generation. Embodiments of computer network architecture automatically identify, measure, and generate insight reports of underperformance and over performance in healthcare practices. Embodiments may generate the insight reports of performance either occasionally on demand, or periodically, or as triggered by events such as an update of available data. Embodiments may include a combination of system databases with data provided by system users, and third-party databases to generate the insight reports, including social media data, financial data, socio-economic data, medical data, search engine data, e-commerce site data, and other databases.",

    "title": "Method and system for generating dynamic, interactive visual representations of information structures within a computer",
    "abstract": "A method and system for generating dynamic, interactive visual representations of information structures within a computer which enable humans to efficiently process vast amounts of information. The boundaries of the information system containing the information to be processed are established and a set of mathematical relationships is provided which indicates the degree of correlation between parameters of interest to a user and segments of information contained within the boundaries. A visual display is generated for the user which has a plurality of different iconic representations and visual features corresponding to the parameters defined by the mathematical relationships. The iconic representations and visual features of the visual display change with the movement of the mathematical relationships within the boundaries of the information system according to the degree of correlation between the parameters of interest and the segment of information through which the mathematical relationships are passing.",

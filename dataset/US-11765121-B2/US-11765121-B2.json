    "abstract": "Provided herein are systems and methods for providing concurrent connection maximization. Operations include repeatedly increasing a quantity of logical connections between a source email sender and a destination email recipient server and tracking a quantity of logical connections; receiving a connection refusal signal and recording the tracked quantity of logical connections as active upon receipt; storing in a recipient status data set the active quantity of logical connections; and upon initiation of a new message send request to a recipient at the destination email recipient server, configuring a plurality of concurrent connections to the destination email recipient server based on the tracked quantity of logical connections and stored for the destination email recipient server; and sending messages over a portion of the plurality of concurrent connections within a threshold indicated by the tracked quantity of logical connections stored for the destination email recipient server.",
    "claims": "\n1. A computer-implemented method for providing concurrent connection maximization, the method comprising:\nincreasing a quantity of logical connections for sending a first plurality of messages from a sender to a recipient server until a connection refusal signal is received from the recipient server;\ngenerating a record of a number of active logical connections that are active at a point in time when the connection refusal signal is received; and\ninitiating, by the sender, a new message send request to send a second plurality of messages to the recipient server, wherein the sender:\ncreates a number of message transfer agents and a number of new logical connections within a threshold of the number of active logical connections specified by the record; and\nsends, using the message transfer agents of the sender, the second plurality of messages over the number of new logical connections to the recipient server.\n2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the source email sender is at least one of a sender email server or a message transfer agent of a message management platform.\n3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein each logical connection indicates a recipient of a message in a message management platform.\n4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising configuring a message management platform based on the number of active logical connections specified by the record.\n5. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, wherein the record is stored within a recipient status data set.\n6. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, wherein configuring the message management platform includes determining the number of message transfer agents for deployment of the message management platform based upon a message transfer goal.\n7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the sender is a message transfer agent of a message management platform and the number of new logical connections are between the message transfer agent and the recipient server.\n8. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising configuring the number of message transfer agents of a message management system to limit a number of the concurrent connections to the recipient server to no more than the threshold of the number of active logical connections specified by the record.\n9. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising maximizing a number of concurrent connections between a first source email sender server and a message transfer agent deployed in a message management platform for sending messages to recipients, wherein maximizing the number of concurrent connections is based on the threshold of the number of active logical connections specified by the record.\n10. A non-transitory computer program product residing on a computer readable storage medium having a plurality of instructions stored thereon which, when executed across one or more processors, causes at least a portion of the one or more processors to perform operations comprising:\nincreasing a quantity of logical connections for sending a first plurality of messages from a sender to a recipient server until a connection refusal signal is received from the recipient server;\ngenerating a record of a number of active the logical connections that are active at a point in time when the connection refusal signal is received; and\ninitiating, by the sender, a new message send request to send a second plurality of messages to the recipient server, wherein the sender:\ncreates a number of message transfer agents and a number of new logical connections within a threshold of the number of active logical connections specified by the record; and\nsends, using the message transfer agents of the sender, the second plurality of messages over the number of new logical connections to the recipient server.\n11. The non-transitory computer program product of claim 10, wherein the sender is at least one of a sender email server or a message transfer agent of a message management platform.\n12. The non-transitory computer program product of claim 10, wherein each logical connection indicates a recipient of a message in a message management platform.\n13. The non-transitory computer program product of claim 10, wherein the operations further comprise configuring a message management platform based on the number of active logical connections specified by the record.\n14. The non-transitory computer program product of claim 13, wherein the record is stored within a recipient status data set.\n15. The non-transitory computer program product of claim 13, wherein configuring the message management platform includes determining the number of message transfer agents for deployment of the message management platform based upon a message transfer goal.\n16. The non-transitory computer program product of claim 10, wherein the sender is a message transfer agent of a message management platform and the number of new logical connections are between the message transfer agent and the recipient server.\n17. The non-transitory computer program product of claim 10, wherein the operations further comprise configuring the number of message transfer agents of a message management system to limit a number of concurrent connections to the recipient server to no more than the threshold of the number of active logical connections specified by the record.\n18. A system for providing concurrent connection maximization, the system comprising:\na memory comprising instructions; and\na processor that executes the instructions to perform operations including:\nincreasing a quantity of logical connections for sending a first plurality of messages from a sender to a recipient server until a connection refusal signal is received from the recipient server;\ngenerating a record of a number of active logical connections that are as active at a point in time when the connection refusal signal is received; and\ninitiating, by the sender, a new message send request to send a second plurality of messages to the recipient server, wherein the sender:\ncreates a number of message transfer agents and a number of new logical connections within a threshold of the number of active logical connections specified by the record; and\nsends, using the message transfer agents of the sender, the second plurality of messages over the number of new logical connections to the recipient server.\n19. The system of claim 18, wherein a portion of the message transfer agents are in a networked communication relationship with the recipient server and are configured based on threshold of the number of active logical connections specified by the record.\n20. The system of claim 18, wherein the operations include determining the number of message transfer agents for deployment of a message management platform based upon a message transfer goal."

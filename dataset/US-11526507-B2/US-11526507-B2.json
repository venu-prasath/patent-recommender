    "abstract": "A computing system uses neural networks to translate natural language queries to database queries. The computing system uses a plurality of machine learning based models, each machine learning model for generating a portion of the database query. The machine learning models use an input representation generated based on terms of the input natural language query, a set of columns of the database schema, and the vocabulary of a database query language, for example, structured query language SQL. The plurality of machine learning based models may include an aggregation classifier model for determining an aggregation operator in the database query, a result column predictor model for determining the result columns of the database query, and a condition clause predictor model for determining the condition clause of the database query. The condition clause predictor is based on reinforcement learning.",

The method of claim 1, wherein the analyzing of the values includes mapping the plurality of input parameters onto a plurality of fuzzy sets and applying a set of fuzzy rules, wherein the fuzzy rules are defined by the fuzzy expert system.\n3. The method of claim 2, wherein the fuzzy rules are applied according to a hierarchy specified by a fuzzy inference engine of the fuzzy expert system.\n4.

The method of claim 4, wherein the plurality of membership functions includes at least one of a triangular, a trapezoidal, and a sinusoidal membership function.\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein the input parameters are defined as linguistic variables.\n7. The method of claim 1, wherein the crisp value is computed based on defuzzification of at least one fuzzy set and corresponding membership degrees.\n8. The method of claim 1, wherein the fuzzy result is based on at least one fuzzy set, including at least one of a triangular, a trapezoidal, and a sinusoidal membership function.\n9. The method of claim 1, wherein at least some of the input parameters are related to a description of a deviation defining the problem, the input parameters including at least one of a user's impact and the urgency of the problem.\n10. The method of claim 1, wherein the analyzing of the values further includes determining similar problems based on at least one of the input parameters.\n11. The method of claim 1, further comprising applying a plurality of models with different grades of fuzziness to the input parameters, for each model, analyzing a set of test values for the plurality of input parameters with the fuzzy expert system thereby calculating a test result, rating the test results for each model, and selecting one of the plurality of models based on the rating.\n12. The method of claim 1, wherein, when a problem classified into a category based on an associated linguistic value has a corresponding crisp value that exceeds or falls below a threshold, the problem is reclassified into a neighboring category associated with a second linguistic value.\n13. A non-transitory computer-readable medium having instructions stored thereon, wherein said instructions, in response to execution by a computing device, cause said computing device to perform a method comprising:\nmaintain a plurality of description of problems, each description comprising a plurality of input words specifying the problem;\nfor each maintained description of a problem, map the plurality of input words onto a plurality of fuzzy sets, and calculate a fuzzy result by applying a set of fuzzy rules to the plurality of fuzzy sets, wherein the fuzzy result includes a combination of a linguistic value of a linguistic variable based on the fuzzy result and a defuzzified numerical value of the fuzzy result indicative of a priority of the problem, wherein in order to prioritize the problems said computing device is to use respective combinations associated with the problems to:\nclassify the problems according to respective linguistic values into a set of categories, and\nafter the problems are classified into the set of categories, to grade the problems of each category of the set of categories according to respective defuzzified numerical values;\nprioritize the problems based on the linguistic values and the numerical values of the respective fuzzy results;\nrank the problems for which respective priorities were determined, the problems being ordered for execution based on their respective priorities, wherein each problem is assigned to a respective category and a corresponding grade within that category;\nanalyze a number of input words specifying a respective problem of the problems and types of the input words of the respective problem, wherein the types of the input words include at least one of an urgency of the respective problem or an impact of the respective problem; and\nselect a fuzzy expert system from a group of fuzzy expert systems based on the analysis, wherein the fuzzy expert system defines the set of fuzzy rules; and\nprovide at least one of the ranked problems among the set of other problems.\n14.

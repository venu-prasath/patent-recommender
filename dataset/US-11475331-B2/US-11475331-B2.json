    "abstract": "A source of bias identification (SoBI) tool is provided that identifies sources of bias in a dataset. A bias detection operation is performed on results of a computer model, based on an input dataset, to generate groupings of values for a protected attribute corresponding to a detected bias in the operation of the computer model. The SoBI tool generates a plurality of sub-groups for each grouping of values. Each sub-group comprises an individual value, or a sub-range, for the protected attribute. The SoBI tool analyzes each of the sub-groups in the plurality of sub-groups, based on at least one source of bias identification criterion, to identify one or more sources of bias in the input dataset. The SoBI tool outputs a bias notification to an authorized computing device specifying the one or more sources of bias in the input dataset.",

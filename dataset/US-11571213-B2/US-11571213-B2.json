    "abstract": "A staple cartridge can comprise a plurality of staples positioned within a cartridge body, wherein the cartridge body can comprise a tissue-contacting deck and a plurality of ridges extending from the tissue-contacting deck. The ridges can be configured to prevent, or reduce the possibility of, tissue from moving relative to the staple cartridge during use. The staple cartridge can further comprise a plurality of staple cavities, wherein each staple cavity can comprise an opening in the deck which is at least partially surrounded by a ridge. The ridges can comprise a uniform height or a height which varies along the length thereof. The height can vary relative to a proximal end and a distal end of the cartridge body and/or between the center of the cartridge body and the side.",

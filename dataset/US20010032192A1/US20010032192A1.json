    "abstract": "A method and apparatus are provided for issuing secondary programmable account numbers (SPANs) to a customer or customer-designated party, each of which SPANs is associated with a customer primary account or other financial instrument, and each of which SPANs has selected usage parameters assigned thereto. SPANs may be issued as a book, with usage parameters assigned to the book in addition to or instead of individual SPANs. When a SPAN is presented to a merchant for payment, the SPAN, including compliance with usage parameters, is verified and appropriate action taken based on either verification or failure of verification.",

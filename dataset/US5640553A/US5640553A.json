    "title": "Relevance normalization for documents retrieved from an information retrieval system in response to a query",
    "abstract": "A method for searching a database of an information retrieval system in response to a query having a query length of at least one word, for applying the query word to the database and selecting information from the database according to the query word. The query is received and the length of the query is determined. Information is selected from the database according to the query. The relevance of the selected information is determined according to matches between the query and the information. The determined relevance of the selected information is adjusted according to the length of the query.",

A method for searching a database of an information retrieval system in response to a query having a query length of at least one query word for applying said query word to said database and selecting information from said database in accordance with said query word, comprising the steps of:\n(a) receiving said query by said information retrieval system;\n(b) determining said query length;\n(c) selecting information from said database in accordance with said query;\n(d) determining a relevance of said selected information in accordance with said query and said selected information; and\n(e) adjusting said determined relevance of said selected information in accordance with said length query.\n2. The method for searching in an information retrieval system of claim 1, further comprising the step of adjusting said determined relevance to make said adjusted relevance independent of said query length.\n3. A system for searching a database of an information retrieval system in response to a query having a query length of at least one query word for applying said query word to said database and selecting information from said database in accordance with said query word, comprising:\na selected query received by said information retrieval system;\na query length representative of the number of words in said selected query;\ninformation selected from said database in accordance with said selected query;\na relevance of said selected information determined in accordance with said selected query and said selected information; and\nan adjusted relevance of said selected information determined in accordance with determined relevance and said length query.\n4. The system for searching in an information retrieval system of claim 3, wherein said determined relevance is adjusted to make said adjusted relevance independent of said query length.",

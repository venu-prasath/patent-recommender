    "title": "Integrating campaign management and data mining",
    "abstract": "Method and apparatus are disclosed for integration of campaign management and data mining. The method and apparatus disclose incorporating references to data mining models into the campaign management process. In some embodiments, this permits evaluating the data mining model for fewer than all of the records in a database, potentially saving computation time. The method and apparatus can include building queries for a database or ranking criteria for records in a database that include a reference to a data mining model.",

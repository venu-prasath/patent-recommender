    "title": "Highly parallel computation network with means for reducing the algebraic degree of the objective function",
    "abstract": "A highly interconnected analog network is constructed with inter-neurons that account for energy function terms of order greater than two. The network comprises analog amplifiers that are connected with a resistive interconnection matrix which connects each amplifier output to the input of all other amplifiers. The connections embodied in the matrix are achieved with conductances whose values are computed in accordance with the set of problem restrictions, while the cost variables of the problem which are to be minimized are incorporated in the input signals.",

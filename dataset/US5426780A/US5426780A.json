    "title": "System for dynamic segmentation analysis using conversion of relational data into object-oriented data",
    "abstract": "Dynamic segmentation of Geographical Information System (GIS) map data, stored in a relational database, converts linear-feature fixed-length attribute arrays, stored as columns in a relational table, into variable length attribute and location arrays for inclusion into an object-oriented map database which can be scanned for candidate values in the attribute and location arrays meeting certain search criteria. Selection of the scanned values is provided for. The object-oriented database may be queried to return the regions, specified in region coordinates, in each of the variable length location arrays, corresponding to the selected attribute values. The intersection of found regions with the selected values from the value arrays can be thereby determined.",

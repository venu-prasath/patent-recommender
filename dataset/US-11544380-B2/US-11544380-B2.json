    "abstract": "In some embodiments, a processor can receive an input string associated with a potentially malicious artifact and convert each character in the input string into a vector of values to define a character matrix. The processor can apply a convolution matrix to a first window of the character matrix to define a first subscore, apply the convolution matrix to a second window of the character matrix to define a second subscore and combine the first subscore and the second subscore to define a score for the convolution matrix. The processor can provide the score for the convolution matrix as an input to a machine learning threat model, identify the potentially malicious artifact as malicious based on an output of the machine learning threat model, and perform a remedial action on the potentially malicious artifact based on identifying the potentially malicious artifact as malicious.",

    "title": "Device for controlling gas turbine engines",
    "abstract": "The electronic device for controlling gas turbine engines includes a plurality of transducers which will generate electrical signals proportional to speed, temperature and pressure to indicate instantaneous operational conditions of the engine. These signals are processed in an electronic circuit and compared with optimum signals to provide an output signal for controlling a servo valve in the fuel feed circuit for the engine.",

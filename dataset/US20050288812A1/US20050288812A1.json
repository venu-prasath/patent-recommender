    "abstract": "A quality prognostics system and a quality prognostics method for predicting the product quality during manufacturing processes are disclosed. The present invention utilizes the current production tool parameters sensed during the manufacturing process and several previous quality data collected from the measurement tool to predict the future product quality. The quality prognostics system is composed of conjecture modeling means and prediction modeling means. The conjecture modeling means itself also can be applied for the purpose of virtual metrology. Further, the quality prognostics method possesses a self-searching means and a self-adjusting means for searching the best combination of various parameters/functions used by the conjecture algorithm or prediction algorithm; and meeting the requirements of new equipment parameters and conjecture/prediction accuracy.",

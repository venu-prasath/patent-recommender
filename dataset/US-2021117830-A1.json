    "abstract": "In an inference verification method for verifying a trained first machine learning algorithm, a set of data samples are input to each of a plurality of at least three different trained machine learning algorithms and a set of outcomes are obtained from each algorithm. The plurality of trained machine learning algorithms are the same as the algorithm to be verified except that each of the plurality has been trained using training data samples where at least some of the outcomes are different as compared to training data samples used to train the first algorithm. For each sample in the data set input to the plurality, the method further comprises determining whether all of the outcomes from the plurality are the same. When all of the outcomes from the plurality are the same, the first algorithm is reported as being potentially defective for that sample in the input data set.",

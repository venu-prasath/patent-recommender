    "abstract": "Techniques for facilitating learning of one or more ontological rules of a resource description framework database are provided. The techniques include obtaining ontology vocabulary from a resource description framework database, generating a rule hypothesis by incrementally building upon a previously learnt rule from the database by adding one or more predicates to the previously learnt rule, performing a constraint check on the generated rule hypothesis by determining compatibility with each previously learnt rule to ensure that a complete rule set including each previously learnt rule and the generated rule hypothesis is consistent, validating the rule hypothesis as a rule using one or more association rule mining techniques to determine validity of the rule hypothesis against the database, and applying the rule to the database to infer one or more facts from the database to facilitate learning of one or more additional ontological rules.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method for facilitating learning of one or more ontological rules of a resource description framework database, wherein the method comprises:\nobtaining ontology vocabulary from a resource description framework database;\ngenerating a rule hypothesis, wherein generating a rule hypothesis comprises incrementally building upon a previously learnt rule from the resource description framework database by adding one or more predicates selected from the ontology vocabulary to the previously learnt rule;\nperforming a constraint check on the generated rule hypothesis, wherein performing a constraint check on the generated rule hypothesis comprises determining compatibility with each previously learnt rule to ensure that a complete rule set including each previously learnt rule and the generated rule hypothesis is consistent;\nvalidating the rule hypothesis as a validated rule using one or more association rule mining techniques with a rule confidence parameter to determine validity of the rule hypothesis against the resource description framework database; and\napplying the validated rule to the resource description framework database to constrain space in the resource description framework database for one or more additional ontological rules and to infer one or more facts from the resource description framework database;\nlearning one or more additional ontological rules based on the one or more facts inferred from the resource description framework database, wherein the one or more additional ontological rules comprise one or more additional predicates than the validated rule.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein applying the rule to the resource description framework database to infer one or more facts from the resource description framework database comprises applying the validated rule to the resource description framework database using a rule-based logical reasoning module.\n3. The method of claim 1, further comprising using one or more facts learnt via applying the validated rule to the resource description framework database as a basis for validating one or more future rule hypotheses.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein validating the rule hypothesis as a validated rule using one or more association rule mining techniques with a rule confidence parameter to determine validity of the rule hypothesis against the resource description framework database comprises using one or more association rule mining techniques with a rule confidence parameter and a rule support parameter.\n5. The method of claim 1, further comprising storing a rule induced from the resource description framework database that passes a threshold of at least one of support and confidence.\n6. The method of claim 1, further comprising utilizing a feedback loop to improve coverage, wherein utilizing a feedback loop comprises applying one or more previously learnt rules to the resource description framework database to infer one or more new facts which are used as a basis for discovering one or more additional ontological rules.\n7. The method of claim 1, further comprising generating an alert if an assertion involving one or more instances invalidates one or more rules in the resource description framework database.\n8. The method of claim 1, wherein the resource description framework database uses resource description framework syntax for specifying one or more assertions and one or more facts about one or more instances.\n9. The method of claim 8, wherein each of the one or more facts is associated with a probability score.\n10. The method of claim 1, wherein adding one or more predicates selected from the ontology vocabulary to the previously learnt rule comprises adding one or more predicates to a body of the previously learnt rule.\n11. The method of claim 1, wherein adding one or more predicates selected from the ontology vocabulary to the previously learnt rule comprises adding one or more predicates to a head of the previously learnt rule.\n12. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more predicates are selected from the ontology vocabulary and combined using one or more operators allowed within a logic expressivity of the resource description framework database.\n13. The method of claim 1, wherein validating the rule hypothesis against one or more instances from the resource description framework database comprises using association rule mining techniques.\n14. The method of claim 1, wherein performing a constraint check on the generated rule hypothesis comprises using one or more parameters to judge validity of the rule hypothesis.\n15. The method of claim 1, further comprising adding one or more inferred facts to the resource description framework database.",

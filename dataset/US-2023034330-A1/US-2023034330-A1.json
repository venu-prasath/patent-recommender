    "abstract": "A reasoning engine is disclosed. Contemplated reasoning engines acquire data relating to one or more aspects of various environments. Inference engines within the reasoning engines review the acquire data, historical or current, to generate one or more hypotheses about how the aspects of the environments might be correlated, if at all. The reasoning engine can attempt to validate the hypotheses through controlling acquisition of the environment data.",

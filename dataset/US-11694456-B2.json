    "abstract": "Systems, methods and computer program products for detecting objects using a multi-detector are disclosed, according to various embodiments. In one aspect, a computer-implemented method includes defining an analysis profile comprising an initial number of analysis cycles dedicated to each of a plurality of detectors, where each detector is independently configured to detect objects according to a unique set of analysis parameters and/or a unique detector algorithm. The method also includes: receiving digital video data that depicts at least one object; analyzing the digital video data using some or all of the detectors in accordance with the analysis profile, where the analyzing produces an analysis result for each detector used in the analysis. Further, the method includes updating the analysis profile by adjusting the number of analysis cycles dedicated to at least one of the detectors based on the analysis results.",

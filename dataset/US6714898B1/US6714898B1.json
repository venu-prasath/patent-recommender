    "title": "Flexible noise figure measurement apparatus",
    "abstract": "An instrument is provided for measuring a noise figure with significant flexibility. The instrument includes a noise source (306) and a vector network analyzer (VNA) (300). The VNA (300) includes an external connector port (302) for removable connection of the noise source (306). The noise source (306) can be connected to the VNA backplane port (302), or directly to a DUT (350). The DUT (350) can be connected to both VNA test ports (310,314) if the noise source (306) is connected to port (302), or only to test port (314) if the noise source (306) is directly connected to the DUT. A receiver connected to the test port (314) includes a downconverter (324) providing an IF signal through either a narrowband IF channel (350) or a wideband IF channel (352) for providing both wideband and narrowband power measurements enabling fast accurate measurement of a noise figure.",

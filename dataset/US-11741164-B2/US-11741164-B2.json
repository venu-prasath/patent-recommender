    "abstract": "The invention provides a system and method for providing ttx-based categorization services and a categorized commonplace of shared information. Currency of the contents is improved by a process called conjuring/concretizing wherein users' thoughts are rapidly infused into the Map. As a new idea is sought, a goal is created for a search. After the goal idea is found, a ttx is concretized and categorized. The needs met by such a Map are prior art searching, competitive environmental scanning, competitive analysis study repository management and reuse, innovation gap analysis indication, novelty checking, technology value prediction, investment area indication and planning, and product technology comparison and feature planning.",
    "claims": "1. A computer-implemented method to manage the display of information, the information in a form selected from the group of: a taxonomy, a tree data structure, a forest of trees data structure, a categorization, a graph, a directed graph, a precedence diagram, a graphical forest, and a combination of a plurality of the foregoing; the information in a logically correct arrangement according to a paradigm selected from the group of: the subjective opinion of the user, the subjective opinion of the user considering the opinions of others, the objective opinion as formed by a crowd, the consensus opinion of an ensemble of machine learning results, the subjective opinion of the user considering an ensemble of machine learning results, and the subjective opinion of the user considering the opinions of others as well as an ensemble of machine learning results; comprising:\na. defining a knowledge model comprising the organization of said information, wherein said information includes objects selected from the group of: cnxpts representing concepts, at least one association between cnxpts the association representing a relationship between concepts, and zero or more fxxts based on the information stored regarding the plurality of cnxpts and the at least one association wherein a fxxt meets one condition selected from the group of: no association is marked with a fxxt, no cnxpt is marked with a fxxt, at least one cnxpt is marked with at least one fxxt, and at least one cnxpt participates in one or more associations marked with at least one fxxt;\nb. providing a computer storage to hold said information;\nc. generating, using a map definition referencing the set of zero or more fxxts, a derived ontology for one or more domains of wisdom by extracting references to zero or more associations and zero or more cnxpts into the derived ontology;\nd. generating, using said map definition referencing the set of zero or more fxxts, a skeletal structure for a map instance for said one or more domains of wisdom from the extracted derived ontology wherein the resulting map skeletal structure of said map instance is based upon a manner of analysis selected from the group of: a spanning forest manner, a descendent forest manner, an enhanced descendent forest manner, an ascendant forest manner, an enhanced ascendant forest manner, and a structure comprising a combination thereof;\ne. generating, using said map definition referencing the set of zero or more fxxts, one or more organizations of knowledge to structure a map instance for said one or more domains of wisdom from the extracted derived ontology wherein the resulting map structure of said map instance is based upon a manner of map assembly selected from the group of: a spanning forest manner, a hierarchical manner, an enhanced descendent forest manner, an enhanced ascendant forest manner, a vertical manner, a directed graph manner, a graph manner, a horizontal manner, a depth augmented manner, a time augmented manner, a purlieu augmented manner, and a structure comprising a combination thereof, wherein vertical and horizontal are mere duals for labeling in combinations;\nand\nf. providing to the user said one or more domains of wisdom for utilization in a form selected from the group of:\ni. providing access to the data contained in said one or more organizations of knowledge for one or more domains of wisdom of said map instance for utilization directed at a solution of a problem the user is considering;

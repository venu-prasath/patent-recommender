    "title": "Process and system for arrangement of documents",
    "abstract": "According to one embodiment of the present invention, a system (10) for arrangement of documents (13) is provided. The system includes a document repository (12) storing a plurality of documents (13). An arrangement engine (14) is coupled to the document repository (12). The arrangement engine (14) is operable to build a plurality of symmetric matrices based upon a plurality of identified arrangements of the plurality of documents (13) in the document repository (12). Each matrix is structured such that each row and each column is associated with a document (13). The arrangement engine (14) is also operable: to fill each cell of each symmetric matrix with a relevance value representing a relevance between a document (13) associated with the row of the cell and a document (13) associated with the column of the cell, to generate a fitness value for each matrix based upon a magnitude and a position of each relevance value by analyzing each symmetric matrix using a fitness function (16), to identify an optimal arrangement of the plurality of documents (13) based upon the fitness value of each matrix, and to provide the optimal arrangement of documents (18) as system output.",

    "abstract": "A computer-implemented method for predicting financial risk, which includes receiving first transaction data pertaining to transactions performed on a first financial account. The first financial account represents a financial account issued to a given account holder by a first account issuer. The method further includes receiving second transaction data pertaining to transaction performed on a second financial account different from the first financial account. The second financial account represents a financial account issued to the given account holder by a second account issuer different from the first account issuer. There is further included scoring the first transaction data and the second transaction data based on a preexisting model to form a score for the account holder. Additionally, there is included transmitting, if the score is below a predefined financial risk threshold, the score to one of the first account issuer and the second account issuer.",

    "title": "Facilities control method",
    "abstract": "A multi-facility control system includes a controller and attendant memory. Stored in the memory are a plurality of rules, each of which includes a conditional portion representative of a condition to be examined and a conclusive portion describing action to be taken when the condition is satisfied. Also stored in memory is the current status of each facility, information representative of the tasks to be performed by the facilities and updated status information resulting from the satisfaction of the conditional parts of the rules. The controller monitors the status of the facilities and compares monitored status information with the conditional parts of the rules stored in memory. When rule conditions are satisfied, control instructions are generated which are employed to produce command signals that are coupled to the respective facilities for controlling the operations thereof.",

    "claims": "\n1. A control system having a controller, for controlling the operation of a plurality of facilities in real time, and memory, coupled to said controller, for storing information in accordance with which said controller controls the operation of said facilities, wherein\nsaid memory comprises\na rule memory portion which stores information representative of a plurality of rules, each rule containing a conditional portion which describes at least one condition to be examined and a conclusive portion which describes an action to be taken upon said condition being satisfied, and\na status memory portion which stores information representative of the current status of each of said facilities, information representative of respective tasks to be performed by said facilities and information representative of the new current status of each of said facilities resulting from the satisfaction of the conditional part of a rule and wherein\nsaid controller comprises\ndetecting means for detecting the current status of each of said facilities and generating information representative thereof,\ninput means, coupled with said detecting means, for coupling facility status representative information generated by said detecting means to the status memory portion of said memory to be stored thereby,\nrule applying means for comparing current status information stored in said status memory with information representative of the conditional portions of the rules stored in said rule memory portion and, in response to the satisfaction of the conditional part of a rule, causing information representative of the conclusive portion of that rule to be stored as the new current status of a facility in the status memory portion of said memory, and for generating information representative of control instructions for controlling the operation of said facilities, said control instruction information being formed by a combination of rules conditional portions of which have been satisfied by the current status of said facilities, and\noutput means, coupled to said rule applying means, for generating command signals for controlling the operation of said facilities in accordance with the control instruction information generated by said rule applying means, and coupling said command signals to respective ones of said facilities.\n2. A control system according to claim 1, wherein information stored in said status memory portion representative of tasks to be performed by said facilities includes information representative of a schedule of tasks to be performed, and wherein rule information stored in said rule memory portion includes information representative of rules the conditional portions of which prescribe relationships between said task schedule and the status of respective ones of said facilities and the conclusive portions of which prescribe tasks of said schedule to be executed.\n3. A control system according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the rule memory portion of said memory includes a rule management portion for storing information representative of respective groups of said rules and wherein said rule applying means includes means for accessing said rule management portion in response to prescribed status information for a facility, whereby only the rules of a specified group are employed by said rule applying means as a result of said prescribed status information.\n4. A control system according to claim 1, wherein the conclusive portion of a rule contains a fixed portion and a parameter portion, said parameter portion being capable of representing a variable and assuming any desired value.\n5. A control system according to claim 1, wherein said memory further includes a portion storing information representative of the name of a procedure defined in the conclusive portion of a rule and a portion storing information representative of that portion of memory wherein information representative of steps for carrying out said procedure is located.\n6. A control system according to claim 1, wherein the rule portion of said memory further includes a portion which stores rule type information representative of whether or not a rule is employed for finally generating a control instruction, and wherein said rule applying means includes means for generating information representative of control instructions in accordance with said rule type information when processing of a rule associated therewith has been carried out.",

    "abstract": "Data processing systems and methods are disclosed for combining video content with one or more augmentations to produce augmented video. Objects within video content may have associated bounding boxes that may each be associated with respective RGB values. Upon user selection of a pixel, the RGBA value of the pixel may be used to determine a bounding box associated with the RGBA value. The client may transmit an indicator of the determined bounding box to an augmentation system to request augmentation data for the object associated with the bounding box. The system then uses the indicator to determine the augmentation data and transmits the augmentation data to the client device.",

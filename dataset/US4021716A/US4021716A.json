    "title": "Reactionless gimbal drive system",
    "abstract": "A reactionless drive system is disclosed comprising in combination a base, a torquer mechanism, the stator portion of which is affixed to the counter-rotational inertia member and accepting control signals from sources external to the system. A rotatable member, coupled to the torquer, is driven in a first direction. A torque compensator consisting of stator and rotor members is coupled between the base and the first mentioned rotatable member in one instance, and to an oppositely rotating member in another instance. All the foregoing components act together to maintain angular momentum of the system during its operative mode to a value of substantially zero. An electronic subsystem is provided which senses the angular velocities of the rotating members and provides a feedback signal to the torque compensator.",

    "abstract": "A recommendation process includes the consideration of the compatibility of the items being recommended. An electronic processing system for generating a compatibility-aware recommendation output set to a is user based, at least in part, on a set of item compatibility rules. The system includes a processing system of one or more processors configured to receive applicable data, including i) user preference data, and ii) item compatibility rules, and to produce a compatibility-aware recommendation output set using the user preference data and the item compatibility rules. A method and computer-readable storage device containing the method are also presented.",

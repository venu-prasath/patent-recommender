    "abstract": "A system includes a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) transceiver, a processor, and a memory. The memory stores program instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the system to receive a signal representative of an FMCW signal reflected from an object of interest, apply a first Fourier transform to the signal to obtain range data, identify a subset of the range data corresponding to a region of interest, apply a second Fourier transform on the identified subset of the range data to obtain velocity data corresponding to the identified subset of the range data, and identify a gesture performed by the object of interest based on at least a portion of velocity data.",

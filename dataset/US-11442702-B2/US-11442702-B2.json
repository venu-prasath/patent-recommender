    "abstract": "A system and method may provide assistance to programmers during programming to reduce the number of routine tasks that must be performed. In some aspects, the system may suggest one or more code snippets that comprise code completions. The code snippets may be single or multi-token. In some aspects, the system may provide predictive editing or predictive navigation, where the system may predict edits or navigation actions based on a programmer's actions. In some aspects, the system is based on machine learning methods and is trained on past actions of programmers in a code editor.",

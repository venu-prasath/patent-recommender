    "abstract": "Embodiments provide systems and methods for navigating a dialogue flow using a trained intelligence bot. Upon initiation of a chat session between a user and a trained intelligence bot, one or more utterances can be received. The utterances can be processed using the trained intelligence bot to resolve an intent from among a plurality of predefined intents, where the intelligence bot is trained to resolve predefined intents based on training data associated with the predefined intents. A predefined dialogue flow associated with the resolved intent can be navigated using the intelligence bot, where the intelligence bot guides the user through the dialogue flow using context variables that are associated with the user or the chat session. The user can be provided enterprise data retrieved by the intelligence bot using a retrieval request generated based on one or more of the navigation of the dialogue flow or the context variables.",

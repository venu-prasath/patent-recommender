    "abstract": "A technique for detecting missing rules (mr) with most general conditions in a rule project (1) having a given scope with a fixed number of objects of a given type, wherein each rule (r) is defined by at least one test (t) in respect to at least one condition of at least one attribute (age, value) of the object, the method comprising the steps of finding at least one missing case not covered by the rules (r), identifying a list of tests (t) that occur in the rules (r), generalizing the missing case into a family of missing cases (mc) in terms of the tests (t) occurring in the rules (r), generalizing the family of missing cases (mc) into a missing rule (mr), and generating missing rules (mr) with most general conditions.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method performed by a computer for detecting missing rules with most general conditions in a rule project comprising rules having a given scope with a fixed number of objects of a given type, the method comprising the steps of:\nthe computer finding at least one missing case not covered by the rules;\nthe computer identifying tests that occur in the rules;\nthe computer generalizing the at least one missing case into a family of missing cases in terms of the tests that occur in the rules;\nthe computer generalizing the family of missing cases into a missing rule; and\nthe computer generating missing rules with most general conditions, wherein the step of generalizing the at least one missing case into the family of missing cases in terms of the tests that occur in the rules comprises finding a minimal set of tests that cover the family of missing cases but do not cover any cases covered by the rules, and wherein the step of finding the minimal set of tests that cover the family of missing cases but do not cover any of the cases covered by the rules comprises:\nordering the tests according to broadest coverage of an object; and\nstepping through the tests ordered and verifying whether a selected test covers any case covered by the rules.\n2. The method according to claim 1, further comprising a step of splitting rules having disjunctions in a condition into a set of rules without disjunctions and having a same coverage.\n3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the step of generalizing the at least one missing case into the family of missing cases in terms of the tests that occur in the rules further comprises removing irrelevant tests in respect to the family of missing cases.\n4. The method according to claim 1, wherein the step of generalizing the at least one missing case into the family of missing cases in terms of the tests that occur in the rules further comprises ordering the tests according to broadest coverage of an object.\n5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the step of finding the minimal set of tests that cover the family of missing cases but do not cover any of the cases covered by the rules further comprises separating the tests into two groups and verifying if one group of the tests creates an overlap with existing rules and, in case no overlap is created, taking solely this group of tests for further processing.\n6. The method according to claim 1, wherein the step of finding the minimal set of tests that cover the family of missing cases but do not cover any of the cases covered by the rules further comprises applying a timeout at a beginning of the finding step and taking a current set of tests as the minimal set of tests at expiry of the timeout.\n7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the method is applied to all missing cases of the rules project.\n8. The method according to claim 7, wherein the step of finding at least one missing case not covered by the rules further comprises finding at least one missing case not covered by the rules of the rules project and already identified missing rules.\n9. The method according to claim 1, wherein each rule in the rule project is defined by at least one test in respect to at least one condition of at least one attribute of an object of the fixed number of objects.",

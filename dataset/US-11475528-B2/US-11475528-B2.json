    "abstract": "A system for autonomous issuance and management of insurance policies for computer and information technology related risks, including but not limited to losses due to system availability, cloud computing failures, current and past data breaches, and data integrity issues. The system will use a variety of current risk information to assess the likelihood of operational interruption or loss due to both accidental issues and malicious activity. Based on these assessments, the system will be able to autonomously issue policies, adjust premium pricing, process claims, and seek re-insurance opportunities with a minimum of human input.",
    "claims": "\n1. A system for autonomous issuance and management of insurance policies for operational interruption and losses associated with computer and technology related risks, comprising:\na network-connected server comprising a memory and a processor;\na deep web extraction engine comprising a first plurality of programming instructions stored in the memory and operable on the processor, wherein the first plurality of programming instructions, when operating on the processor, cause the network-connected server to gather data about a plurality of potential risks related to use to computer and information technology;\na cyber risk analysis engine comprising a second plurality of programming instructions stored in the memory and operable on the processor, wherein the second plurality of programming instructions, when operating on the processor, cause the network-connected server to analyze the likelihood of operational interruption or loss from a plurality of computer and information technology related risks by utilizing machine learning to predict risk from both accidental events and deliberate malicious activity; and\nan automated underwriting processor comprising a fourth plurality of programming instructions stored in the memory and operable on the processor, wherein the fourth plurality of programming instructions, when operating on the processor, cause the network-connected server to:\ncreate a contract block by compiling the request into a computational graph-based format;\nlink the contract block to the requester;\nstore the contract block into memory;\nretrieve a plurality of available underwriting agreements from memory; and\ncreate an offer list by performing computational graph operations on the contract block to determine at least a risk-transfer agreement based at least on calculated risk associated with the request, contextual consideration of an existing contract portfolio, and the plurality of available underwriting agreements.\n2. The system of claim 1, wherein at least a term and a condition of an offer are added to the contract block after the requester agrees to the terms of an offer from the offer list.\n3. The system of claim 2, further comprising a claims processor comprising a fifth plurality of programming instructions stored in the memory and operable on the processor, wherein the fifth plurality of programming instructions, when operating on the processor, cause the network-connected server to:\nreceive a claim request from an insured;\nretrieve a contract block linked to the insured;\nprocess the claims request to determine a payout amount based at least on a term and a condition stored in the graph-based dataset; and\nprocess the payout amount using a billing and payments manager.\n4. The system of claim 1, wherein at least a portion of the information contained in the contract block is risk characterization of the contract block, allowing external operations to be peril-agnostic and model-agnostic.\n5. A method for autonomous management of risk transfer, comprising the steps of:\n(a) gathering a variety of data from about a plurality of potential risks related to use to computer and information technology;\n(b) analyzing the likelihood of operational interruption or loss from a plurality of computer and information technology related risks, by utilizing machine learning to predict risk from both accidental events and deliberate malicious activity;\n(c) creating a contract block by compiling the request into a computational graph-based format, with an automated underwriting processor;\n(d) linking the contract block to the requester, with the automated underwriting processor;\n(e) storing the contract block into memory, with the automated underwriting processor;\n(f) retrieving a plurality of available underwriting agreements from memory, with the automated underwriting processor; and\n(g) creating an offer list by performing computational graph operations on the contract block to determine at least a risk-transfer agreement based at least on calculated risk associated with the request, contextual consideration of an existing contract portfolio, and the plurality of available underwriting agreements, with the automated underwriting processor.\n6. The method of claim 5, wherein at least a term and a condition of an offer are added to the contract block after the requester agrees to the terms of an offer from the offer list.\n7. The method of claim 6, further comprising the steps of:\nreceiving a claim request from an insured;\nretrieving a contract block linked to the insured;\nprocessing the claims request to determine a payout amount based at least on a term and a condition stored in the graph-based dataset; and\nprocessing the payout amount using a billing and payments manager.\n8. The method of claim 5, wherein at least a portion of the information contained in the contract block is risk characterization of the contract block, allowing external operations to be peril-agnostic and model-agnostic."

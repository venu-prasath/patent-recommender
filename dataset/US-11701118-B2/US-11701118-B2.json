    "abstract": "A powered endoscopic surgical apparatus is provided and includes a handle including a housing, a power source supported in the housing; an endoscopic portion extending distally from the housing of the handle; an end effector assembly coupled to a distal end of the endoscopic portion, the end effector assembly including a pair of jaws configured to perform a surgical function; a driving member; a drive source including a motor powered by the power source and connected to the driving member; and a gear assembly engaged with the motor. The gear assembly including a gear rack provided on the driving member; and a main gear operatively connected with the gear rack, the motor spinning the main gear such that rotary motion of the main gear moves the driving member in an axial direction such that the driving member actuates the end effector to perform the surgical function.",
    "claims": "\n1. A battery powered surgical apparatus comprising:\na handle including a housing;\nan endoscopic portion extending distally from the housing and defining a longitudinal axis;\na fastening assembly coupled to a distal end of the endoscopic portion, the fastening assembly including a pair of jaws defining a stapling mechanism, at least one of the jaws being movable with respect to the other jaw;\na drive source proximal of the endoscopic portion, the drive source including a motor powered by a battery and connected to a drive shaft; and\na gear assembly engaged with the drive shaft of the motor, the gear assembly disposed within the housing and including:\na drive gear connected to a driving member configured to actuate the endoscopic portion; and\na main gear operatively connected with the drive gear, the motor being adapted and configured to spin the main gear such that rotary motion of the main gear moves the drive gear linearly in an axial direction within the housing, parallel to the longitudinal axis, to impart an axial force on a corresponding member in the endoscopic portion to engage and actuate the stapling mechanism in the fastening assembly.\n2. The battery powered surgical apparatus of claim 1, wherein the drive gear is a gear rack.\n3. The battery powered surgical apparatus of claim 1, wherein the drive gear is a drive screw.\n4. The battery powered surgical apparatus of claim 1, wherein the drive source is at least partially disposed within a protective housing connected to an outside surface of the housing and the drive shaft extends into the housing to engage the gear assembly.\n5. The battery powered surgical apparatus of claim 1, wherein the driving gear is a gear rack including a bottom driving surface connected to the main gear.\n6. A powered endoscopic surgical apparatus, comprising:\na handle including a housing, a power source supported in the housing;\nan endoscopic portion extending distally from the housing of the handle;\na fastening assembly coupled to a distal end of the endoscopic portion, the fastening assembly including a pair of jaws defining a stapling mechanism, at least one of the jaws being movable with respect to the other jaw;\na firing member extending between the handle and the fastening assembly;\na drive source proximal of the endoscopic portion, the drive source including a motor powered by the power source and connected to the firing member; and\na gear assembly engaged with a drive shaft of the motor, the gear assembly being disposed within the housing, the gear assembly including:\na driving gear operatively associated with the firing member; and\na main gear operatively connected with the driving gear, the motor being adapted and configured to spin the main gear such that rotary motion of the main gear moves the driving gear linearly in an axial direction such that a distal end of the firing member engages and actuates the stapling mechanism in the fastening assembly.\n7. The endoscopic surgical apparatus of claim 6, wherein the driving gear is formed along a bottom surface of the firing member.\n8. The endoscopic surgical apparatus of claim 6, wherein the driving gear is a drive screw.\n9. The endoscopic surgical apparatus of claim 6, wherein the handle further includes:\na manually actuated closing lever supported on the housing; and\na closure member having a proximal end operatively connected to the closing lever and a distal end extending through the endoscopic portion to the fastening assembly, wherein manual actuation of the lever imparts linear movement of the closure member in an axial direction such that the distal end of the closure member engages and actuates the fastening assembly to open and close the pair of jaws.\n10. The endoscopic surgical apparatus of claim 9, wherein the handle further includes a trigger supported on the housing, wherein the trigger is operatively connected to the power source, the power source being operatively connected to the motor of the drive source such that manipulation of the trigger actuates the power source to activate the motor and rotate the main gear to actuate the firing member.\n11. The endoscopic surgical apparatus of claim 9, further comprising a controller configured to control the motor, the controller delaying activation of the motor for a predetermined time period after actuation of the lever.\n12. The endoscopic surgical apparatus of claim 11, wherein the predetermined time period is suitable in length to allow compression of the tissue for the predetermined time period and to allow tissue to settle from a first initial state into a second compressed state when the pair of jaws are in a closed position.\n13. The endoscopic surgical apparatus of claim 11, further comprising a dampening device, the controller configured to control the dampening device, the dampening device modulating the motor for the predetermined time period to allow for compression of tissue when the pair of jaws are in a closed position.\n14. The endoscopic surgical stapler of claim 11, wherein the controller controls the motor and delays an actuation thereof, the delay permitting a predetermined compression time period when the pair of jaws are in a closed position.\n15. The endoscopic surgical stapler of claim 14, wherein the controller slows an operation of the motor to provide for the delay to compress the tissue.\n16. The endoscopic surgical stapler of claim 11, wherein the handle includes a switch supported on the housing, wherein the lever actuates the switch upon actuation thereof,\nwherein the switch, when actuated, outputs a signal to the controller to complete a suitable timer circuit for a predetermined time interval.\n17. The endoscopic surgical stapler of claim 16, wherein upon passage of the predetermined time interval, actuation of the motor is permitted.\n18. The endoscopic surgical apparatus of claim 6, wherein the power source is a battery.\n19. The endoscopic surgical apparatus of claim 18, wherein the battery is modular.\n20. A powered endoscopic surgical apparatus, comprising:\na handle including a housing, a power source supported in the housing;\nan endoscopic portion extending distally from the housing of the handle;\nan end effector assembly coupled to a distal end of the endoscopic portion, the end effector assembly including a pair of jaws configured to perform a surgical function, at least one of the jaws being movable with respect to the other jaw;\na driving member extending between the handle and the end effector assembly;\na drive source proximal of the endoscopic portion, the drive source including a motor powered by the power source and connected to the driving member; and\na gear assembly engaged with a drive shaft of the motor, the gear assembly being disposed within the housing, the gear assembly including:\na drive gear supported on the driving member; and\na main gear operatively connected with the drive gear of the driving member, the motor being adapted and configured to spin the main gear such that rotary motion of the main gear axially translates the drive gear to move the driving member linearly in an axial direction such that a distal end of the driving member actuates the end effector to perform the surgical function."

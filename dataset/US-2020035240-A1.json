    "abstract": "Mechanisms are provided for mitigating the effects of long term cognitive conditions on patient interactions by providing artificial intelligence mechanisms to assist with such interactions. The mechanisms perform a machine learning operation to learn, for a particular patient, associations between patient indicators and concepts that the patient is attempting to communicate or concepts representing actions that the patient would like to perform within a patient environment. The mechanisms receive, from a monitoring device in a patient environment, a patient input representing an attempt by the patient to communicate a concept or interact with the patient environment. The mechanisms perform a cognitive translation of one or more patient indicators in the patient input to one or more corresponding concepts based on results of the machine learning operation. The mechanisms then generate a translation output specifying the one or more corresponding concepts.",
    "claims": "\n1.

The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning operation is specifically configured for patients afflicted with a cognitive impairment or communication impairment.\n3. The method of claim 2, wherein the cognitive impairment or communication impairment is Wernicke's aphasia.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein the patient indicators comprise at least one of an audible utterance from the patient, a motion or gesture performed by the patient, or a written input of a shape, contour, or word generated by the patient.\n5. The method of claim 1, wherein performing the machine learning operation comprises:\nmonitoring, over a period of time, the particular patient's responses to concept prompts or concept stimuli;\nanalyzing the patient's responses to the concept prompts or concept stimuli to identify patient indicators present in the patient's responses;\nassociating instances of patient indicators in the patient's responses to concepts present in a computer model associated with the particular patient; and\ndetermining, for each concept in the computer model, and for each patient indicator associated with each concept in the computer model, a strength of association between the concept and the patient indicator.\n6. The method of claim 5, wherein the strength of association between the concept and the patient indicator is determined based on a function of a number of instances of the patient indicator being identified in patient responses to concept prompts or concept stimuli associated with the concept as part of the monitoring.\n7. The method of claim 6, wherein the function of the number of instances further comprises a weighted function, where the weights identify a relative number of instances of the patient indicator in the patient responses to the concept prompts or concept stimuli associated with the concept compared to numbers of instances of other patient indicators in patient responses to the concept prompts or concept stimuli associated with the concept.\n8. The method of claim 6, wherein the function of the number of instances further comprises a weighted function that more heavily weights patient indicators that are more recently utilized by the patient in patient responses than other patient indicators that are used less recently in patient responses by the patient.\n9. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nidentifying, based on results of the cognitive translation, a corresponding concept representing an action the patient wants to perform with a device present in the patient environment;\nautomatically generating, by the cognitive translation system, a command to cause the device present within the patient environment to perform the action; and\nautomatically transmitting, by the cognitive translation system, the command to the device to cause the device to perform the action.\n10. The method of claim 1, wherein the cognitive translation system is distributed across a local computing device present within the patient environment, and a remotely located computing system in communication with the local computing device via one or more data networks, and wherein the local computing device receives the patient input and outputs the translation output, and wherein the remotely located computing system performs the machine learning operation and performs the cognitive translation.\n11. A computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having a computer readable program stored therein, wherein the computer readable program, when executed on a computing device, causes the computing device to implement a cognitive patient translation system which operates to:\nperform a machine learning operation to learn, for a particular patient, associations between patient indicators and concepts that the patient is attempting to communicate or concepts representing actions that the patient would like to perform within a patient environment;\nreceive, from a monitoring device in a patient environment, a patient input representing an attempt by the patient to communicate a concept or interact with the patient environment;\nperform a cognitive translation of one or more patient indicators in the patient input to one or more corresponding concepts based on results of the machine learning operation; and\ngenerate a translation output specifying the one or more corresponding concepts.\n12.

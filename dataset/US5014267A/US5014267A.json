    "title": "Video conferencing network",
    "abstract": "A video conferencing network for providing videos, audio, and data communication between remote video terminals. Each of the video terminals transmits and receives video, audio, and data information through the network. The network includes a central switching network for receiving audio and video information on one of a plurality of audio/video ports and selectively interconnecting this information to remaining audio/video ports. A centralized controller is in data communication with each of the video terminals and the switching network and controls the configuration of the switching network to provide the appropriate audio and video paths in response to the data received by the controller from the video terminals.",

    "claims": "\n1. A communication network for integrating video and data, said network comprising:\na plurality of network ports;\na plurality of video terminals each associated with one of said network ports for transmitting and receiving real time video signals and network control data messages, one of said video terminals being configured to originate a call, and one of said video terminals being configured as a destination of said call, a user associated with said call destination terminal;\nmeans, coupled between said call origination terminal and said call destination terminal, for transmitting a video image encoded as a video signal and for transmitting an incoming call data message to said call destination terminal;\nmeans, coupled to said call destination terminal, for displaying said video image at said call destination terminal to provide video information to a user of said call destination terminal prior to establishing said call; and\nmeans, coupled to said call destination terminal, for sending a call answered data message from said call destination terminal to said call origination terminal after the displaying of said video image at said call destination terminal and at the discretion of said call destination terminal user to establish said call.\n2. A network as claimed in claim 1 wherein said call destination terminal additionally comprises means for producing and audible signal from said call destination terminal in response to receipt of said incoming call data message and prior to the displaying of said video image at said call destination terminal.\n3. A network as claimed in claim 1 wherein said call origination terminal comprises means for selectively disabling the transmission of said video signal, said selectively disabling means being engaged at the discretion of said user of said call origination terminal.\n4. A method of establishing a call between a call origination apparatus and a call destination apparatus in a video communication network, said method comprising the steps of:\ntransmitting a request message from said call origination apparatus to an information exchange;\nsending an incoming call data message from said message exchange to said call destination apparatus, a user associated with said call destination apparatus;\nestablishing a video and audio path between said call origination apparatus and said call destination apparatus;\ntransmitting a video image encoded as a video signal to said call destination apparatus concurrently with said step of sending an incoming call data message;\ndisplaying, in response to said transmitting step, said video image at said call destination apparatus to provide video information to a call destination apparatus user about the identity of a user of said call origination apparatus; and\nsending a call answered message from said call destination apparatus to said call origination apparatus after said displaying step and at the discretion of a call destination apparatus user to establish said call.\n5. A method as claimed in claim 4 additionally comprising the step of emitting an audible signal from said call destination apparatus in response to said transmitting step and prior to said displaying step.\n6. A method as claimed in claim 5 wherein said audible signal represents a ring pulse, and said emitting step emits only a single ring pulse prior to said displaying step.\n7. A method as claimed in claim 4 wherein said call origination apparatus selectively disables said transmission of said video signal during said transmitting step at the discretion of said user of said call origination apparatus;.\n8. A method as claimed in claim 4 wherein said call destination apparatus has two display screens, and one of said two display screens is smaller than the other, said method additionally comprising the step of routing said video signal only to said smaller one of said two display screens during said displaying step for display of said video image thereon.",

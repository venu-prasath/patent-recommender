    "title": "Method and system for accessing a remote database using pass-through queries",
    "abstract": "A method for accessing a database server using pass-through queries includes parsing a database query to separate a pass-through string, and then sending a pass-through string to retrieve information regarding the structure of a remote table. The method further includes fetching data as needed from the remote table, and caching the remote data in a temporary table in memory of the local computer system. The system includes a query processor to compile the database query, a remote engine to retrieve table structure information and fetch data as needed, and a temporary table manager to manage caching of the fetched data.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for accessing a database server on a computer network using a pass-through query, the method comprising:\nreceiving a database query in a local database management system in a local computer system during runtime of the local database management system;\nparsing the database query to identify the pass-through query in the database query;\nfrom the local computer system on the computer network, sending the pass-through query to the database server to obtain table structure data associated with results of the pass-through query;\nreceiving the table structure data of the results of the pass-through query from the database server;\ncaching the table structure data in a temporary table in main memory of the local computer system;\ndetermining whether requested results are already cached in the temporary table in response to a user request for the requested results;\nfetching the data as needed from the database server to obtain the requested results of the pass-through query if the requested results are not already cached in the temporary table;\ncaching the requested results in the temporary table if the requested results are not already cached in the temporary table; and\nusing the table structure data to create an interface for fetching data from the database server;\nand using the interface as an input to a local database operation in the database query performed by the local database management system in the local computer system.\n2. The method of claim 1 including the step of compiling the database query including a first and second pass-through query in the local computer system;\nissuing the first and second pass-through queries to a database server to obtain a first table structure data associated with results of the first pass-through query, and a second table structure data associated with results of the second pass-through query;\nreceiving the first and second table structure data of the results of the first and second pass-through queries from the database server;\nusing the first and second table structure data to create first and second interfaces for fetching data from the database server;\ncaching the first and second table structure data in a first and second temporary table, respectively, in main memory of the local computer system;\nfetching data from the database server to obtain requested results of the first pass-through query if the requested results are not already cached in the first temporary table;\ncaching the requested results of the first pass-through query in the first temporary table if the requested results are not already cached in the first temporary table;\nfetching data from the database server to obtain requested results of the second pass-through query if the requested results are not already cached in the second temporary table; and\ncaching the requested results of the second pass-through query in the second temporary table if the requested results are not already cached in the second temporary table.\n3. The method of claim 1 wherein the step of sending the pass-through query includes sending a pass-through string to the database server for execution and requesting a description of column data associated with the pass-through query.\n4. The method of claim 1 wherein the table structure data is an array of column data associated with the pass-through query.\n5. A method for accessing a database server on a computer network using a pass-through query, the method comprising:\nreceiving a database query in a local computer system on the computer network;\nparsing the database query to determine whether the database query includes a pass-through query including a pass-through string; and\nif the database query includes a pass-through query, then sending the pass-through string without modification to the database server for execution by a remote database management system on the database server;\nrequesting table structure data representing results of the pass-through query from the database server;\nreceiving the table structure data representing the results of the pass-through query from the database server;\nfetching data from the database server to obtain requested results of the pass-through query as needed;\ncaching the requested results in a temporary table in main memory of the local computer system; and\nin the local database management system, performing a local database operation on the pass-through query as expressed by a user in the database query, by using the table structure data representing the results of the pass-through query as input to the local database operation.\n6. The method of claim 5 further including the step of creating the temporary table to store the results of the pass-through query in response to receiving the table structure data.\n7. The method of claim 6 further including the step of caching the table structure data in the temporary table.\n8. The method of claim 5 further including the steps of:\ncaching the table structure data in the temporary table;\nreceiving a user request to provide results of the pass-through query at the local computer system;\ndetermining whether the user request requires fetching of requested results from the database server; and\nif the fetching of requested results from the database server is required, then fetching data from the database server to obtain the requested results of the pass-through query as needed.\n9. The method of claim 8 wherein the determining step includes checking the temporary table to determine whether the requested results are present in the temporary table.\n10. The method of claim 5 wherein the local database operation is a join operation between the results of the pass-through query and a local base table.\n11. The method of claim 5 wherein the local database operation is a join operation between the results of the pass-through query and results of a second pass-through query.\n12. A programmed local computer system on a computer network for accessing a database server on the computer network using a pass-through query comprising:\na query processor for parsing a database query to identify a pass-through query in the database query;\na remote engine in communication with the query processor for receiving the pass-through query from the query processor, and, in communication with the database server on the computer network, for executing the pass-through query to obtain table structure data representing results of the pass-through query, and for fetching requested results of the pass-through query; and\na temporary table manager in communication with the remote engine for caching table structure data in a temporary table in local memory, and, in communication with the remote engine, for caching requested results of the pass-through query; and wherein the query processor is operable to parse the database query including both the pass-through query and a local database operation on the pass-through query, and is operable to perform the local database operation on the results of the pass-through query.\n13. The programmed local computer system of claim 12 wherein the remote engine is in communication with the temporary table manager for determining whether user requested results are cached in the temporary table.\n14. The programmed local computer system of claim 12 wherein the local database operation is a join operation.\n15. The programmed local computer system of claim 12 further including a user interface operable to enable a user to enter the database query including the pass-through query and the local database operation on the pass-through query; and\nwherein the query processor is operable to parse the database query including both the pass-through query and the local database operation on the pass-through query, and is operable to perform the local database operation on the results of the pass-through query.",

    "abstract": "Methods and systems for monitoring use and determining risks associated with operation of a vehicle having one or more autonomous operation features are provided. According to certain aspects, operating data may be recorded during operation of the vehicle. This may include information regarding the vehicle, the vehicle environment, use of the autonomous operation features, and/or control decisions made by the features. The control decisions may include actions the feature would have taken to control the vehicle, but which were not taken because a vehicle operator was controlling the relevant aspect of vehicle operation at the time. The operating data may be recorded in a log, which may then be used to determine risk levels associated with vehicle operation based upon risk levels associated with the autonomous operation features. The risk levels may further be used to adjust an insurance policy associated with the vehicle.",

    "abstract": "The present invention is a computer-implemented system and method to create an optimal investment plan given wealth goals stated in probabilistic form, and to display the resulting probability distributions of wealth accumulations at future times where the method provides inputs for entering and storing in a computer target and fallback scenarios and required probabilities, computes rate of return values responsive to the user input, generates an efficient portfolio array, computes probabilities for the efficient portfolio array related to the rate of return values, iteratively compares the array probabilities so that the target and fallback scenario probabilities are satisfied and an optimum efficient portfolio is selected and then provides a graphical representation of the selected efficient portfolio.",

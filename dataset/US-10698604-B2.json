    "abstract": "Apparatus and methods are disclosed for providing feedback and guidance to touch screen device users to improve the text entry user experience and performance. According to one embodiment, a method comprises receiving a text entry, receiving input on a touch screen in the form of a first single touch input located over a word of previously entered text, and presenting the user with one or more suggestion candidates indicated possible replacement words related to the selected word. The user can then select one of the suggestion candidates using a second single touch input to replace the selected word with a word associated with the selected suggestion candidate.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method, comprising:\nreceiving, with a text entry device, text input comprising one or more words, wherein at least a portion of the text input is displayed on a touch screen;\nreceiving first touch screen input from the touch screen to select at least one of the words;\nbased on the first touch screen input, selecting at least one of the words and displaying one or more suggestion candidates related to the at least one selected word, at least one of the suggestion candidates including the at least one selected word, wherein the displaying one or more suggestion candidates comprises displaying the at least one selected word within a shape designating an area of the touch screen as a button;\nreceiving a second single touch screen input from the touch screen over a selected one of the suggestion candidates that includes the at least one selected word;\nbased on the receiving the second touch screen input, displaying an indication within the button shape that the at least one selected word does not exist in a candidate source;\nreceiving a third single touch screen input from the touch screen over a selected one of the suggestion candidates that includes the at least one selected word; and\nadding the at least one selected word associated with the selected suggestion candidate to the candidate source.\n2. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nmodifying the text input by automatically replacing the at least one selected word with one or more words associated with the selected suggestion candidate;\nin response to the modifying the text input, checking the modified text input for correctness, wherein the checking comprises determining that a second word of the modified text input is incorrect; and\nhighlighting the second word.\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein the first touch screen input is a single touch screen input.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein the text input is received using a touch screen keyboard, a hardware keyboard or a speech recognition module.\n5. The method of claim 1, wherein the suggestion candidates are displayed adjacent to a keyboard of the text entry device.\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein the suggestion candidates are displayed adjacent to the at least one selected word.\n7. A system comprising:\none or more processors operable to execute computer-executable instructions for text entry and correction;\none or more memory units coupled to the processing units;\none or more touch screens having a display area, the one or more touch screens operable to receive touch input over at least a portion of the display area; and\nstorage for storing the computer-executable instructions for text entry and correction using instructions that cause the processors to:\nreceive text input;\nassociate the text input with a text entry, wherein at least a portion of the text entry is displayed using the display area of the one or more touch screens;\nprocess input from the touch screens, the input including:\nfirst touch screen input received from the one or more touch screens to produce at least one selected word of the text entry, wherein the at least one selected word is identified using the first touch screen input,\nsecond touch screen input received from the one or more touch screens to select one of one or more suggestion candidates, and\nthird touch screen input received from the one or more touch screens to add the at least one selected word to a candidate source;\nproduce the suggestion candidates for the at least one selected word, at least some of the suggestion candidates being produced from the candidate source, wherein the at least one selected word is automatically displayed as one of the suggestion candidates, and wherein an add-to-dictionary indicator is presented adjacent the at least one selected word responsive to receiving the second touch screen input, the at least one selected word and the indicator being displayed within a shape designating an area of the one or more touch screens' display as a button; and\nadd one or more words associated with the selected suggestion candidate to the candidate source if the selected word suggestion candidate is selected with the third touch screen input.\n8. The system of claim 7, wherein the instructions further cause the processors to, if the selected suggested candidate is not the selected word:\nautomatically modify the text entry by replacing the at least one selected word with a word associated with the selected suggestion candidate; and\nadd a word associated with the selected suggestion candidate to a candidate source.\n9. The system of claim 7, wherein the text input is received from a touch screen keyboard.\n10. The system of claim 7, wherein the suggestion candidates are displayed adjacent to a touch keyboard area on the touch screen display area.\n11. The system of claim 7, wherein the suggestion candidates are displayed adjacent to the at least one selected word on the touch screen display area.\n12. The system of claim 7, wherein the instructions further cause the processors to:\nmodify the text input by automatically replacing the at least one selected word with one or more words associated with the selected suggestion candidate;\nin response to modifying the text input, check the modified text input for correctness, wherein the checking comprises determining that a second word of the modified text input is incorrect; and\nhighlight the second word.\n13. One or more computer-readable storage media storing computer-executable instructions that when executed cause a computer to perform a method, the instructions comprising instructions that cause the computer to:\nreceive text input using a touch screen, the text input including one or more words;\nbased on the text input, select at least one of the words and display one or more suggestion candidates including the at least one selected word, the displaying comprising displaying the selected word within a shape designating an area of the touch screen as a button;\nreceive a second single touch screen input from the touch screen over a selected one of the suggestion candidates that includes the at least one selected word;\nbased on the receiving the second touch screen input, display an add-to-dictionary indicator within a button shape along with the at least one selected word;\nreceive a third single touch screen input from the touch screen over a selected one of the suggestion candidates that includes the at least one selected word; and\nadd the at least one selected word associated with the selected suggestion candidate to the candidate source.\n14. The computer-readable storage media of claim 13, wherein one or more of the suggestion candidates are received from a common speller application programming interface.\n15. The computer-readable storage media of claim 13, wherein one or more of the suggestion candidates are received from a service provider in a computing cloud.\n16. The computer-readable storage media of claim 13, wherein the instructions further cause the computer to:\ndetermine a rank order using one or more ranks received from one or more of the following: a system dictionary, a user dictionary, a common speller application programming interface, or an input history data source; and\nwherein the suggestion candidates are arranged on the touch screen according to the rank order.\n17. The computer-readable storage media of claim 13, wherein:\nthe selected suggestion candidate is a complete word; and\nthe selected suggestion candidate is added to a system dictionary, a user dictionary, a common speller application programming interface, or an input history data source.\n18.

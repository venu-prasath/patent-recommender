    "abstract": "Systems and methods for machine comprehension are provided. In example embodiments, a machine accesses a context and a question related to the context. The machine determines a low-level meaning of the question and a low-level meaning of the context, the low-level meaning corresponding to words or phrases. The machine determines a high-level meaning of the question and a high-level meaning of the context, the high-level meaning corresponding to sentences or paragraphs. The machine computes, for each position i in the context, a first probability that an answer to the question starts at the position i. The machine computes, for each position j in the context, a second probability that the answer to the question ends at the position j. The machine determines the answer to the question based on the computed first probabilities and the computed second probabilities.",

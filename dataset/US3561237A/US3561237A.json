    "title": "Predictive gauge control method and apparatus for metal rolling mills",
    "abstract": "A PROGRAMMED COMPUTER CONTROL SYSTEM PROVIDES ON LINE PREDICITIVE ROLL FORCE GUAGE CONTROL FOR A TANDEM HOT STEEL STRIP MILL. A GAUGE CONTROL PROGRAM CALCULATES SCREWDOWN MOVEMENT PREDICTIVELY REQUIRED FOR OPTIMUM OR NEAR OPTIMUM GAIN CORRECTION OF ROLL FORCE ERROR ON THE BASIS OF ON LINE DETECTED ROLL FORCE AND SCREWDOWN POSITION VALUES AND ON THE BASIS OF PREDETERMINED MILL SPRING CONSTANT AND WORKPIECE PLASTICITY VALUES. TO COMPENSATE FOR STEADY STATE GAUGE ERROR CONDITIONS, A SCREWDOWN OFFSET MOVEMENT VALUE IS DETERMINED AND COMBINED WITH THE ROLL FORCE ERROR CORRECTING SCREWDOWN MOVEMENT VALUE TO DEFINE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CORRECTIVE SCREWDOWN MOVEMENT REQUIRED AT ANY PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. THE CONTROL SYSTEM OPERATES THE MILL SCREWDOWN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROGRAM CALCULATIONS.",

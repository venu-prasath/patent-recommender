    "abstract": "In some implementations, an event timeline that includes one or more interactions between a customer and a supplier may be determined. A starting value may be assigned to individual events in the event timeline. A sub-sequence comprising a portion of the event timeline that includes at least one reference event may be selected. A classifier may be used to determine a previous relative value for a previous event that occurred before the reference event and to determine a next relative value for a next event that occurred after the reference event until all events in the event timeline have been processed. The events in the event timeline may be traversed and a monetized value index assigned to individual events in the event timeline.",

    "abstract": "Disclosed is a Social-Topical Adaptive Networking (STAN) system that can inform users of cross-correlations between currently focused-upon topic or other nodes in a corresponding topic or other data-objects organizing space maintained by the system and various social entities monitored by the system. More specifically, one of the cross-correlations may be as between the top N now-hottest topics being focused-upon by a first social entity and the amounts of focus \u2018heat\u2019 that other social entities (e.g., friends and family) are casting on the same topics (or other subregions of other cognitive attention receiving spaces) in a relevant time period.",

The method of claim 5, wherein the card-commonality is calculated at least in part based on the one or more query-filters of the card.7. The method of claim 3, further comprising updating the card-commonality of one or more subsequent cards of the card stack based on a current action of the first user in relation to a currently displayed card.8. The method of claim 1, further comprising modifying the order of one or more subsequent cards of the card stack based on actions of the first user with respect to one or more previously displayed cards.9. The method of claim 1, wherein one or more of the user-engagement factors comprise one or more of demographic information, current information, or social-graph information of the first user.10. The method of claim 1, wherein the card stack is displayed in the card-stack interface as a stack of cards.11. The method of claim 1, wherein the card-stack interface is a user interface of a native application or a webpage accessed by a browser client.12. The method of claim 1, wherein the communication network is an online social network.13. The method of claim 1, each query further referencing one or more query-filters for the query-domain, wherein each query-filter references one or more objects of the communication network.14. The method of claim 13, further comprising displaying a subsequent card of the card stack to the first user in response to detecting an input from the first user corresponding to a swipe of a previously displayed card, the subsequent card having a same query-domain and one or more different query-filters as the previously displayed card.15. The method of claim 13 wherein, for each card stack, each card corresponds to a query referencing a particular query-domain and a different query-filter.16. The method of claim 13, wherein, for each card stack, each card corresponds to a query referencing a particular query-filter and a different query-domain.17. A method comprising, by a computing device:\nreceiving, from a client system of a first user of a communication network, an input from the first user to access a card-stack interface;\ngenerating one or more card stacks from a plurality of cards,\neach card comprising a query referencing a query-domain associated with the communication network, each query further referencing one or more query-filters for the query-domain, wherein each query-filter references one or more objects of the communication network,\neach card stack comprising one or more cards from the plurality of cards, the cards being formed into card stacks based on a card-commonality between the cards;\nsending, to the client system in response to the input from the first user, the card-stack interface for display to the first user, wherein the card-stack interface comprises one or more of the card stacks; and\nmodifying one or more of the query-filters of one or more cards of the card stack based on previous actions of the first user in relation to one or more of the cards.receiving, from a client system of a first user of a communication network, an input from the first user to access a card-stack interface;generating one or more card stacks from a plurality of cards,\neach card comprising a query referencing a query-domain associated with the communication network, each query further referencing one or more query-filters for the query-domain, wherein each query-filter references one or more objects of the communication network,\neach card stack comprising one or more cards from the plurality of cards, the cards being formed into card stacks based on a card-commonality between the cards;each card comprising a query referencing a query-domain associated with the communication network, each query further referencing one or more query-filters for the query-domain, wherein each query-filter references one or more objects of the communication network,each card stack comprising one or more cards from the plurality of cards, the cards being formed into card stacks based on a card-commonality between the cards;sending, to the client system in response to the input from the first user, the card-stack interface for display to the first user, wherein the card-stack interface comprises one or more of the card stacks; andmodifying one or more of the query-filters of one or more cards of the card stack based on previous actions of the first user in relation to one or more of the cards.18.

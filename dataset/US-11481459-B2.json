    "abstract": "An inferential user matching system can determine a mutual interest between a first user and a second user. Based on determining the mutual interest, the system can transmit an expression of interest indication to a portable device(s) of the first and/or second user.",
    "claims": "\n1. An inferential user matching system comprising:\none or more processors; and\na memory storing software that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the inferential user matching system to:\ninfer a number of trends corresponding to a plurality of users utilizing the inferential user matching system;\nbased on the inferred trends, determine a mutual interest between a first user and a second user;\nbased on the mutual interest, transmit, over one or more networks, (i) a first representation of the first user to a portable device of the second user, and (ii) a second representation of the second user to a portable device of the first user;\nbased on transmitting the first and second representations, detect an expression of interest from the first user; and\nbased on detecting the expression of interest from the first user, transmit an interest indication to the portable device of the second user.\n2. The inferential user matching system of claim 1, wherein the executed software further causes the inferential user matching system to:\nbased on the interest indication, provide a contact feature to the portable device of the second user to enable contact between the first and second users.\n3. The inferential user matching system of claim 1, wherein the executed software further causes the inferential user matching system to:\nin response to transmitting (i) the first representation of the first user to the portable device of the second user, and (ii) the second representation of the second user to the portable device of the first user, monitor each of the first and second users for one or more physiological responses.\n4. The inferential user matching system of claim 3, wherein the detected expression of interest corresponds to a detected physiological response from the first user.\n5. The inferential user matching system of claim 4, wherein the detected physiological response comprises at least one of an utterance, a gesture, a movement, or a body position.\n6. The inferential user matching system of claim 4, wherein the detected physiological response corresponds to at least one of breathing rate, heart rate, perspiration, blood pressure, or a galvanic response.\n7. The inferential user matching system of claim 1, wherein the executed software further causes the inferential user matching system to:\norganize the plurality of users into a set of sub-communities, each sub-community comprising a set of common interests.\n8. The inferential user matching system of claim 1, wherein the executed software further causes the inferential user matching system to:\nbased on the number of trends corresponding to the plurality of users, transmit at least one of a recommendation or an advertisement to portable devices of the plurality of users.\n9. The inferential user matching system of claim 8, wherein the number of trends corresponds to one or more of a location of the plurality of users or common interests of the plurality of users.\n10. The inferential user matching system of claim 8, wherein the plurality of users are comprised in a sub-group of the inferential user matching system.\n11. A non-transitory computer readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to:\ninfer a number of trends corresponding to a plurality of users utilizing an inferential user matching system;\nbased on the inferred trends, determine a mutual interest between a first user and a second user;\nbased on the mutual interest, transmit, over one or more networks, (i) a first representation of the first user to a portable device of the second user, and (ii) a second representation of the second user to a portable device of the first user;\nbased on transmitting the first and second representations, detect an expression of interest from the first user; and\nbased on detecting the expression of interest from the first user, transmit an interest indication to the portable device of the second user.\n12. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 11, wherein the executed instructions further cause the one or more processors to:\nbased on the interest indication, provide a contact feature to the portable device of the second user to enable contact between the first and second users.\n13. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 11, wherein the executed instructions further cause the one or more processors to:\nin response to transmitting (i) the first representation of the first user to the portable device of the second user, and (ii) the second representation of the second user to the portable device of the first user, monitor each of the first and second users for one or more physiological responses.\n14. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 13, wherein the detected expression of interest corresponds to a detected physiological response from the first user.\n15. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 14, wherein the detected physiological response comprises at least one of an utterance, a gesture, a movement, or a body position.\n16. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 14, wherein the detected physiological response corresponds to at least one of breathing rate, heart rate, perspiration, blood pressure, or a galvanic response.\n17. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 11, wherein the executed instructions further cause the one or more processors to:\norganize the plurality of users into a set of sub-communities, each sub-community comprising a set of common interests.\n18. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 11, wherein the executed instructions further cause the one or more processors to:\nbased on the number of trends corresponding to the plurality of users, transmit at least one of a recommendation or an advertisement to portable devices of the plurality of users.\n19. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 18, wherein the number of trends corresponds to one or more of a location of the plurality of users or common interests of the plurality of users.\n20. A computer-implemented method of matching users, the method being performed by one or more processors and comprising:\ninferring a number of trends corresponding to a plurality of users utilizing an inferential user matching system;\nbased on the inferred trends, determining a mutual interest between a first user and a second user;\nbased on the mutual interest, transmitting, over one or more networks, (i) a first representation of the first user to a portable device of the second user, and (ii) a second representation of the second user to a portable device of the first user;\nbased on transmitting the first and second representations, detecting an expression of interest from the first user; and\nbased on detecting the expression of interest from the first user, transmitting an interest indication to the portable device of the second user."

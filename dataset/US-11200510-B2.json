    "abstract": "A mechanism is provided for text classifier training. The mechanism receives a training set of text and class specification pairs to be used as a ground truth for training a text classifier machine learning model for a text classifier. Each text and class specification pair comprises a text and a corresponding class specification. A domain terms selector component identifies at least one domain term in the texts of the training set. A domain terms replacer component replaces the at least one identified domain term in the texts of the training set with a corresponding replacement term to form a revised set of text and class specification pairs. A text classifier trainer component trains the text classifier machine learning model using the revised set to form a trained text classifier machine learning model.",

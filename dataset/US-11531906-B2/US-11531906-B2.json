    "abstract": "Embodiments relate to de-obfuscated data to process at one or more artificial-intelligence (AI) decision nodes throughout a communication decision tree. Through processing directed by the communication decision tree, additional de-obfuscated data is collected and securely transmitted in de-obfuscated or re-obfuscated form to enrich underlying data structures.",

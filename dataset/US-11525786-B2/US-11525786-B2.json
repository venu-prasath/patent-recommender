    "abstract": "An apparatus and method to determine a property of a substrate by measuring, in the pupil plane of a high numerical aperture lens, an angle-resolved spectrum as a result of radiation being reflected off the substrate. The property may be angle and wavelength dependent and may include the intensity of TM- and TE-polarized radiation and their relative phase difference.",
    "claims": "1. A method, comprising:\nusing a liquid in a space between a substrate and a lens;\ndirecting, using the lens, a radiation beam from a radiation source toward a pattern formed on the substrate; and\nmeasuring asymmetries between intensities of corresponding diffraction orders in an angle-resolved spectrum of a radiation beam diffracted from the pattern at a plurality of angles and a plurality of wavelengths substantially simultaneously to measure a property of the substrate.using a liquid in a space between a substrate and a lens;directing, using the lens, a radiation beam from a radiation source toward a pattern formed on the substrate; andmeasuring asymmetries between intensities of corresponding diffraction orders in an angle-resolved spectrum of a radiation beam diffracted from the pattern at a plurality of angles and a plurality of wavelengths substantially simultaneously to measure a property of the substrate.2.

    "title": "Systems, methods and computer program products for monitoring credit risks in electronic trading systems",
    "abstract": "A credit monitoring system in an electronic trading system forms a complex check to determine if two particular counterparties will except each other for a particular trade based upon their respective predefined credit preferences. In accordance with an embodiment, credit preferences imputed by each counterparty with regard to the other counterparty are referenced to determine the trade eligibility of either party with respect to the other for a particular financial transaction instrument. Indication of whether a counterparty can enter into the proposed trade is conveyed to the respective trader, preferably using a color coding scheme in which various colors represent the relevant credit status with regard to the viewing trader. The complex check performed by the system may be embodied in a simple yes/no statement, in terms of maturity of a particular financial instrument, or in terms of a risk quotient (i.e., risk equivalent or RQ) initially determined by the system, though modifiable by the trader.",

    "claims": "\n1. A system for credit screening a proposed electronic trade of a derivative between a first trader and a second trader, comprising:\n2. The system of claim 1, wherein said means for reporting includes a first indication representing that said first and second traders will trade with each other, a second indication representing that said first trader will trade with said second trader but said second trader will not trade with said first trader, and a third indication representing that said second trader will trade with said first trader but said first trader will not trade with said second trader.\n3. The system of claim 2, wherein said means for reporting includes a color coding scheme for presenting said first, second and third indications respectively to said fast and second traders.\n4. The system of claim 3, wherein said color coding scheme includes a first color associated with said first indication, a second color associated with said second indication, and a third color associated with said third indication.\n5. The system of claim 2, further comprising a credit override mechanism to enable trading between said first trader and said second trader when one of said second indication and said third indication is reported to said first trader and said second trader.\n6. The system of claim 1, wherein said first credit preference information is defined in terms of a yes/no statement.\n7. The system of claim 1, wherein said formulated risk equivalent is automatically determined by said system.\n8. The system of claim 1, wherein said first and second credit preference information is maintained in anonymity.\n9. The system of claim 1, wherein said first and second credit preference information can be updated in essentially real-time by said first and second traders, respectively.\n10. The system of claim 1, wherein said first credit preference information is that of said first trader in respect to a second legal entity of said second trader.\n11. The system of claim 1, wherein said second credit preference information is that of said second trader in respect to a first legal entity of said first trader.\n12. The system of claim 1, further comprising means for enabling said first trader to define a shared credit preference for plurality of derivatives in a credit group.\n13. A method for screening order information proposing a trade of a derivative via an electronic trading system, comprising the steps of:\n14. The method of claim 13, further comprising the step of modifying the first credit preference information by the first trader.\n15. The method of claim 13, wherein said step of encoding includes a first indication representing that the first and second traders will trade with each other, a second indication representing that the first trader will trade with the second trader but the second trader will not trade with the first trader, and a third indication representing that the second trader will trade with the first trader but the first trader will not trade with the second trader.\n16. The method of claim 15, further comprising executing an override process to enable trading between said first trader and said second trader when one of said second indication and said third indication are encoded and presented to one of said first trader and said second trader.\n17. The method of claim 13, wherein the first credit preference information and the second credit preference information are defined as preferences with regard to at least one derivative.\n18. The method of claim 13, further comprising the step of maintaining the first and second credit preference information in anonymity.\n19. The method of claim 13, wherein said step of receiving the first credit preference information includes the step of receiving first credit preference information that is defined in terms of a yes/no statement.\n20. The method of claim 13, further comprising the step of determining the formulated risk equivalent automatically by the electronic trading system.\n21. The method of claim 13, wherein said step of encoding includes an indication presented to the first trader representing that the first trader will trade with the second trader but the second trader will not trade with the first trader, further comprising the step of providing a credit over-ride process that allows the first trader to deal with the second trader directly if the second trader agrees.\n22. The method of claim 13, wherein the step of receiving first credit preference information comprises receiving first credit preference information defining a credit preference of said first trader in respect to a second legal entity of said second trader.\n23. The method of claim 13, wherein the step of receiving second credit preference information comprises receiving second credit preference information defining a credit preference of said second trader in respect to a first legal entity of said first trader.\n24. The method of claim 13, further comprising defining a credit preference for a credit group having a plurality of derivatives.\n25. The system of claim 24, wherein said first trader can modify the derivatives in said credit group.\n26. The method of claim 25, wherein said first trader posts a price and said second trader is provided said third indication, wherein said step of executing said override process comprises:\n27. A computer program product for use with a data processing system for credit screening of order information proposing a trade of a derivative via an electronic trading system, said computer program product comprising:\n28. The computer product of claim 27, wherein said computer readable program code means for reporting includes a first indication representing that said first and second traders will trade with each other, a second indication representing that said first trader will trade with second trader but said second trader will not trade with said first trader, and a third indication representing that said second trader will trade with said first trader but said first trader will not trade with said second trader.\n29. The computer program product of claim 27, wherein said first credit preference information defines preferences with regard to a single derivative.\n30. The computer program product of claim 27, wherein said first credit preference information is defined in terms of a yes/no statement.\n31. The computer program product of claim 27, wherein said formulated risk equivalent is automatically defined by said system.\n32. The computer program product of claim 27, wherein said first and second credit preference information is maintained in anonymity.",

    "title": "Telephony fraud detection using voice recognition techniques",
    "abstract": "A system/method is disclosed for screening telephone system callers, using speaker-dependent text-independent voice recognition, to either prevent excessive fraudulent use of certain telephone system lines (or radio channels) or to selectively restrict classes of service allowed for different users of a common line. The voice recognition process is configured to provide an extent of mismatch indication, between a voice sample taken from a caller immediately using the protected line (or channel) and a recorded reference voice sample, which indication corresponds to the probability that the instant caller is not the same as the person who provided the reference sample. The extent of mismatch indication is compared to a mismatch limit value which can be set to a different magnitude for each call. Different actions are taken depending upon whether the extent of mismatch indication is or is not larger than the limit value. In situations screening for potential fraudulent use of a line/channel, a mismatch indication larger than the set limit is considered representative of possible fraud and further action is taken to either immediately block continuation of the call or to acquire additional information from the caller which can be used to verify authorized usage.",

    "claims": "\n1. A system for controlling access to a resource comprising:\nmeans for storing a reference voice sample of an authorized user of said resource;\nmeans for obtaining a \"dirty\" voice sample from a person seeking access to said resource;\nmeans for applying a voice recognition process to said dirty and reference voice samples, to derive an indication therefrom of the extent of mismatch between said samples;\nmeans for setting a variable mismatch limit related specifically to conditions pertaining to allowable uses of said resource;\nmeans for determining if said derived mismatch indication exceeds said related mismatch limit; a determination that said derived mismatch indication exceeds said related mismatch limit being considered indicative that the person seeking access is probably not said authorized user associated with said reference voice sample, and a determination that said derived mismatch indication does not exceed said related mismatch limit being considered indicative that the person seeking access could be said authorized user;\nmeans for utilizing said determination that said derived mismatch indication does not exceed said related mismatch limit for permitting said person seeking access to said resource to have access to said resource; and\nmeans for utilizing said determination that said derived mismatch indication exceeds said related mismatch limit for initiating further action to control access to said resource by said person seeking access to said resource.\n2. An access controlling system in accordance with claim 1 wherein said resource is an information transmission channel in a communication network.\n3. An access controlling system in accordance with claim 2 wherein said resource is a voice transmission channel in a telephone communication network.\n4. An access controlling system in accordance with claim 1 wherein said means for applying a said voice recognition process to said samples utilizes a voice recognition process that is speaker-dependent but text-independent, wherein text-independent means independent of words contained in said dirty and reference samples.\n5. An access controlling system in accordance with claim 1 wherein:\nsaid means for storing a reference voice sample of an authorized user is adapted to store plural reference voice samples representing voices of plural different authorized users of said resource;\nsaid means for applying said voice recognition process to said samples applies said process effectively to said dirty voice sample and each of said reference voice samples so as to effectively compare said dirty voice sample to each of said reference voice samples, and to derive indications of the extent of mismatch indications between said dirty sample and each of said reference samples;\nsaid means for determining is effective to determine if at least one of said derived indications does not exceed said related mismatch limit; and\nsaid means for permitting said person seeking access to have said access is responsive to a said determination that at least one of said derived mismatch indications does not exceed said related limit to permit said person to have unobstructed access to said resource.\n6. An access controlling system in accordance with claim 5 wherein said resource is a voice channel of a telephone communication network.\n7. An access controlling system in accordance with claim 1 comprising:\nmeans for obtaining a trusted dirty voice sample which is subject to noise in the environment of said person seeking access to said resource, but otherwise should be identical to said reference voice sample if said person seeking access is using said access controlling system properly;\nmeans for using said trusted dirty sample to effectively adjust said compared samples to correct for said noise in said environment.\n8. An access controlling system in accordance with claim 7 wherein:\nsaid resource is a telephone communication network;\nsaid telephone network includes a radio channel through which said person seeking access is able to access said telephone communication network via a radio-based telephone; and\nsaid trusted dirty voice sample is stored at said radio telephone and transmitted through said radio channel in association with operation of said radio telephone.\n9. An access controlling system in accordance with claim 8 wherein said trusted dirty voice sample is stored within said radio telephone.\n10. An access controlling system in accordance with claim 1 wherein said mismatch limits are subject to variations, dependent upon circumstances of usage of said resource, whereby in at least one circumstance of usage there is a distinct possibility that access to said resource could be granted both to said person providing said reference sample and to a person other than said person providing said reference sample.\n11. A system for controlling access to a voice channel in a telephone communication network comprising:\nmeans for storing a reference voice sample of an authorized user of said voice channel;\nmeans for obtaining a \"dirty\" voice sample from a person seeking access to said voice channel;\nmeans for applying a voice recognition process to said dirty and reference voice samples, to derive an indication therefrom of the extent of mismatch between said samples;\nmeans for setting a variable mismatch limit related specifically to said derived mismatch indication;\nmeans for determining if said derived mismatch indication exceeds said related mismatch limit; a determination that said derived mismatch indication exceeds said related mismatch limit being considered indicative that the person seeking access is probably not the same as said authorized user associated with said reference voice sample, and a determination that said derived mismatch indication does not exceed said related mismatch limit being considered indicative that the person seeking access may be said authorized user;\nmeans for utilizing a said determination that said derived mismatch indication does not exceed said related mismatch limit for permitting said person seeking access to said resource to have access to said resource;\nmeans for utilizing a said determination that said derived mismatch indication exceeds said related mismatch limit for taking further action to control access to said resource by said person seeking access to said resource;\nsaid means for storing a reference voice sample of an authorized user is adapted to store plural reference voice samples representing voices of plural different authorized users of said voice channel;\nsaid means for applying said voice recognition process to said samples applies said process effectively to said dirty voice sample and each of said reference voice samples so as to effectively compare said dirty voice sample to each of said reference voice samples, and to derive indications of the extent of mismatch indications between said dirty sample and each of said reference samples;\nsaid means for determining is effective to determine if at least one of said derived indications does not exceed said related mismatch limit; and\nsaid means for permitting said person seeking access to have said access is responsive to a said determination that at least one of said derived mismatch indications does not exceed said related limit to permit said person to have unobstructed access to said resource; and wherein;\nsaid plural reference voice samples stored by said means for storing constitute reference voice samples of plural groups of authorized users of said voice channel of said telephone network; said groups having different access privileges to said voice channel and including at least a first group entitled to a first class of access to said voice channel and a second group entitled to a second class of access to said voice channel that is different from said first class of access;\nsaid means for determining is effective to compare said dirty voice sample to all of said reference voice samples of said first and second groups of users, and produce an extent of mismatch indication relative to each of said groups that is indicative of the smallest extent of mismatch between the dirty sample and the reference samples in each group; and\nsaid means for utilizing said determinations are effective to determine which reference group is least mismatched to the dirty voice sample, and to permit the caller associated with the dirty sample to have a class of access to said voice channel that corresponds to the class of access assigned to the group having the smallest extent of mismatch to the dirty sample.",

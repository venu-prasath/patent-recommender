    "abstract": "Systems and methods for neural machine translation are provided. In one example, a neural machine translation system translates text and comprises processors and a memory storing instructions that, when executed by at least one processor among the processors, cause the system to perform operations comprising, at least, obtaining a text as an input to a neural network system, supplementing the input text with meta information as an extra input to the neural network system, and delivering an output of the neural network system to a user as a translation of the input text, leveraging the meta information for translation.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method for translating text comprising:\ntraining a neural network system using first meta information associated with a training pair of a source language text and a target language translation, the first meta information indicating a first product category, a first topic, or both;\nreceiving, at the neural network system from a client device, an input text for an electronic commerce listing for an electronic commerce marketplace and second meta information corresponding to the input text, the second meta information indicating a second product category, a second topic, or both, associated with the electronic commerce listing;\ngenerating, using the neural network system, a translation of the input text based at least in part on the second meta information; and\noutputting the electronic commerce listing comprising the translation of the input text for publication via the electronic commerce marketplace.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein the input text is associated with a source language, and wherein the translation is associated with a target language, the method further comprising:\nidentifying a portion of the input text to keep in the source language, wherein generating the translation of the input text comprises refraining from translating the portion of the input text.\n3. The method of claim 2, wherein the portion of the input text comprises a number, a product specification, a brand name, or any combination thereof.\n4. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\ngenerating one or more translated words associated with the input text based at least in part on the second product category, the second topic, or both, wherein the translation of the input text comprises the one or more translated words.\n5. The method of claim 1, wherein the input text comprises at least one source word in a source language which is translatable into two or more target words in a target language different from the source language, the method further comprising:\nselecting a target word for the translation from the two or more target words of the target language based at least in part on the second meta information, wherein the translation of the input text comprises the selected target word.\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein training the neural network system comprises:\ntraining a plurality of model iterations of the neural network system; and\nselecting a model iteration from the plurality of model iterations based at least in part on a translation edit rate associated with the model iteration, a bilingual evaluation understudy metric associated with the model iteration, or both, wherein the input text and the second meta information are received at the selected model iteration of the neural network system.\n7. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\ngenerating a fixed-length vector based at least in part on the input text;\ngenerating a category membership vector based at least in part on the second meta information; and\nreceiving the fixed-length vector and the category membership vector at the neural network system, wherein the category membership vector is configured to influence a target word selection of the translation.\n8. The method of claim 1, wherein the neural network system disambiguates between alternative translations of a word included in the input text based at least in part on the second meta information.\n9. The method of claim 1, wherein the input text comprises a title, a description, or both, of the electronic commerce listing, and wherein the translation of the input text comprises a translation of the title, a translation of the description, or both.\n10. A system for translating text comprising:\none or more processors; and\na non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the system to perform operations comprising:\ntraining a neural network system using first meta information associated with a training pair of a source language text and a target language translation, the first meta information indicating a first product category, a first topic, or both;\nreceiving, at the neural network system from a client device, an input text for an electronic commerce listing for an electronic commerce marketplace and second meta information corresponding to the input text, the second meta information indicating a second product category, a second topic, or both, associated with the electronic commerce listing;\ngenerating, using the neural network system, a translation of the input text based at least in part on the second meta information; and\noutputting the electronic commerce listing comprising the translation of the input text for publication via the electronic commerce marketplace.\n11. The system of claim 10, wherein the input text is associated with a source language, and wherein the translation is associated with a target language, wherein the instructions are further executable by the one or more processors to cause the system to perform operations comprising:\nidentifying a portion of the input text to keep in the source language, wherein generating the translation of the input text comprises refraining from translating the portion of the input text.\n12. The system of claim 11, wherein the portion of the input text comprises a number, a product specification, a brand name, or any combination thereof.\n13. The system of claim 10, wherein the instructions are further executable by the one or more processors to cause the system to perform operations comprising:\ngenerating one or more translated words associated with the input text based at least in part on the second product category, the second topic, or both, wherein the translation of the input text comprises the one or more translated words.\n14.

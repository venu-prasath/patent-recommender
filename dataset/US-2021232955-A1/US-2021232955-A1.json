    "abstract": "Technology for using a computing device to interpret entity and relationship occurrences a natural language understanding system that includes the following operations (not necessarily in the following order): (i) receiving a corpus that includes unstructured data and/or structured data; (ii) parsing the corpus to obtain parsed corpus information; (iii) applying artificial intelligence to the parsed corpus information to determine a plurality of logical relationships manifested by the corpus; and (iv) expressing, by machine logic, the plurality of logical relationships as a respectively corresponding plurality of logical rule expressions, with each logical rule expression of the plurality of logical rule expressions expressing the respectively corresponding logical relationship as fact(s) with regard to the corpus.",
    "claims": "\n1. A computer-implemented method (CIM) comprising:\nreceiving a corpus that includes structured data;\nparsing the corpus to obtain parsed corpus information;\napplying artificial intelligence to the parsed corpus information to determine a plurality of logical relationships manifested by the corpus; and\nexpressing, by machine logic, the plurality of logical relationships as a respectively corresponding plurality of logical rule expressions, with each logical rule expression of the plurality of logical rule expressions expressing the respectively corresponding logical relationship as fact(s) with regard to the corpus.\n2. The CIM of claim 1 further comprising:\ntransmitting at least one logical rule expression of the plurality of logical rule expressions in human understandable form and format to a human user(s).\n3. The CIM of claim 2 further comprising:\napplying natural language processing software to put the at least one transmitted logical rule expression(s) into human understandable form and format, for transmission to human(s).\n4. The CIM of claim 1 further comprising:\nenabling, by a reasoner, a mathematically provable determination of whether there is enough evidence or not to support a specific hypothesis that can be derived from the parsed corpus information.\n5. The CIM of claim 1 further comprising:\nenabling, by a reasoner, a mathematically provable determination of whether there is enough evidence or not to support a conclusion that can be derived from the parsed corpus information.\n6. The CIM of claim 5 wherein the reasoner is implemented as a backward and/or forward chaining collection of rulesets.\n7. A computer-implemented method (CIM) comprising:\nreceiving a corpus that includes unstructured data;\nparsing the corpus to obtain parsed corpus information;\napplying artificial intelligence to the parsed corpus information to determine a plurality of logical relationships manifested by the corpus; and\nexpressing, by machine logic, the plurality of logical relationships as a respectively corresponding plurality of logical rule expressions, with each logical rule expression of the plurality of logical rule expressions expressing the respectively corresponding logical relationship as fact(s) with regard to the corpus.\n8. The CIM of claim 7 further comprising:\ntransmitting at least one logical rule expression of the plurality of logical rule expressions in human understandable form and format to a human user(s).\n9. The CIM of claim 8 further comprising:\napplying natural language processing software to put the at least one transmitted logical rule expression(s) into human understandable form and format, for transmission to human(s).\n10. The CIM of claim 7 further comprising:\nenabling, by a reasoner, a mathematically provable determination of whether there is enough evidence or not to support a specific hypothesis that can be derived from the parsed corpus information.\n11. The CIM of claim 7 further comprising:\nenabling, by a reasoner, a mathematically provable determination of whether there is enough evidence or not to support a conclusion that can be derived from the parsed corpus information.\n12.

The CIM of claim 13 further comprising:\nenabling, by a reasoner, a mathematically provable determination of whether there is enough evidence or not to support a conclusion that can be derived from the parsed corpus information.\n18. The CIM of claim 17 wherein the reasoner is implemented as a backward and/or forward chaining collection of rulesets.\n19. A computer program product (CPP) including:\nset of data storage device(s); and\ncomputer code stored on the set of data storage device(s), with the computer code including data and instructions for causing a processor(s) set to perform at least the following operation(s):\nreceiving a corpus that includes structured data,\nparsing the corpus to obtain parsed corpus information,\napplying artificial intelligence to the parsed corpus information to determine a plurality of logical relationships manifested by the corpus, and\nexpressing, by machine logic, the plurality of logical relationships as a respectively corresponding plurality of logical rule expressions, with each logical rule expression of the plurality of logical rule expressions expressing the respectively corresponding logical relationship as fact(s) with regard to the corpus.\n20. The CPP of claim 19 wherein the computer code further comprising data and instructions for causing the processor(s) set to further perform the following operation(s):\ntransmitting at least one logical rule expression of the plurality of logical rule expressions in human understandable form and format to a human user(s).\n21. The CPP of claim 20 wherein the computer code further comprising data and instructions for causing the processor(s) set to further perform the following operation(s):\napplying natural language processing software to put the at least one transmitted logical rule expression(s) into human understandable form and format, for transmission to human(s).\n22. A computer system (CS) including:\nA processor(s) set;\nset of data storage device(s); and\ncomputer code stored on the set of data storage device(s), with the computer code including data and instructions for causing the processor(s) set to perform at least the following operation(s):\nreceiving a corpus that includes structured data,\nparsing the corpus to obtain parsed corpus information,\napplying artificial intelligence to the parsed corpus information to determine a plurality of logical relationships manifested by the corpus, and\nexpressing, by machine logic, the plurality of logical relationships as a respectively corresponding plurality of logical rule expressions, with each logical rule expression of the plurality of logical rule expressions expressing the respectively corresponding logical relationship as fact(s) with regard to the corpus.\n23.

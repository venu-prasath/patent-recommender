    "title": "FAQ link creation between user's questions and answers",
    "abstract": "A user enters input, or a question in natural language form, and information is retrieved. A questions database is coupled to the input interface and contains questions which are comparable to the input and which the source retrieves in response to an input. An information source is coupled to the input interface and contains information which is relevant to retrieved questions. A searcher is coupled to the input interface for searching the information source for information which is relevant to the input. Information is ranked according to the entered query. A user's question is stored and linked to answers in the questions database. Users may add and link new questions which are not already stored in the questions database.",

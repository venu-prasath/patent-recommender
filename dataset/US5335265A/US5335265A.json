    "title": "Apparatus for detecting and preventing subscriber number cloning in a cellular mobile telephone system",
    "abstract": "This apparatus operates to discern temporal and spatial anomalies in the use of subscriber numbers in the cellular mobile telephone system. The detection of such anomalies is typically indicative of attempted fraudulent access to the cellular mobile telephone system via cloning of valid subscriber numbers. The detection of a bogus subscriber unit is accomplished by recording the call origination and termination patterns associated with the subscriber number. The cloning detection apparatus makes use of call origination data to identify concurrent call originations or receptions for a single subscriber number. However, such events represent only a small portion of the fraudulent calls and a more extensive analysis is typically required to identify subscriber number cloning. This further analysis includes a spatial analysis of successive call activity for a subscriber number. If two successive calls for a particular subscriber number are detected in a time interval that is too short to justify the geographic separation of the subscriber unit for the two successive calls, then this apparatus identifies these two call connections as including one subscriber unit having a cloned subscriber number.",

    "claims": "\n1. In a cellular mobile telephone system, wherein a plurality of mobile telephone switching offices, each of which serves a plurality of cell sites for establishing cellular cell connections with mobile subscriber units located in a geographical area covered by said cell sites, are connected to a subscriber verification system which validates the authorization of subscriber units, each of which is identified by a unique subscriber identification code assigned to said subscriber unit, to receive service when roaming outside of the subscriber's home mobile telephone switching office, apparatus in said subscriber verification system to detect subscriber identification code cloning comprising:\nmeans, responsive to a one of said subscriber units originating a cellular cell connection, for storing data indicative of a subscriber unit identification code assigned to said one subscriber unit and real time call data associated with said cellular call connection; and\nmeans for detecting a temporal anomaly indicative of subscriber number cloning in said stored call data.\n2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said detecting means includes:\nmeans, responsive to a succession of cellular call connections from said one subscriber unit, for indicating said temporal anomaly when the frequency of said succession of cellular call connections exceed a predetermined threshold.\n3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said detecting means includes:\nmeans, responsive to a succession of cellular call connections from said one subscriber unit, for indicating said temporal anomaly when the cumulative duration of said succession of cellular call connections exceeds a predetermined threshold.\n4. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said detecting means includes:\nmeans for indicating a temporal anomaly when more than one cellular call connection for said one subscriber unit with a single subscriber identification code are concurrently extant in said cellular mobile telephone system.\n5. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said detecting means includes:\nmeans for indicating said temporal anomaly when two successive cellular call connections are originated from said one subscriber unit in said cellular communication system at spatially different locations, which call connection originations are temporally separated by a time difference inconsistent with said one subscriber unit traversing said spatial difference.\n6. The apparatus of claim 5 wherein said indicating means includes:\nmeans for calculating a time indicative of the minimum transit time of said one subscriber unit over a geographic distance between said spatially different locations; and\nmeans for identifying said temporal anomaly when said calculated minimum time is greater than said time difference.\n7. The apparatus of claim 5 wherein said identifying means includes:\nmeans for computing a geographic distance between said spatially different locations;\nmeans for calculating a time indicative of the minimum transit time of said one subscriber unit over said computed geographic distance; and\nmeans for indicating said temporal anomaly when said calculated minimum time is greater than said time difference.\n8. The apparatus of claim 1 further including:\nmeans, responsive to said detected temporal anomaly for a call origination from said one subscriber unit, for terminating service to said one subscriber unit.\n9. The apparatus of claim 8 wherein said terminating means includes:\nmeans for transmitting a call denial message identifying said one subscriber unit to a mobile telephone switching office which covers a service area in which said one subscriber unit is presently located.\n10. The apparatus of claim 8 wherein said terminating means includes:\nmeans for transmitting data indicative of said one subscriber unit to an operator to identify the existence of said detected temporal anomaly.\n11. The apparatus of claim 8 wherein said terminating means includes:\nmeans for storing data identifying said one subscriber unit in a service denied memory to prevent said one subscriber unit from receiving cellular service on future call originations.\n12. The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising:\nmeans, responsive to said detected temporal anomaly for a call origination from said one subscriber unit, for transmitting a signal to said one subscriber unit requesting data indicative of a personal identification number that uniquely identifies a subscriber to whom said one subscriber unit is assigned; and\nmeans, responsive to the receipt of said requested data, for enabling said call origination if said received requested data matches a personal identification number stored in a memory in said apparatus.\n13. The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising:\nmeans, responsive to said detected temporal anomaly for a call origination from said one subscriber unit, for comparing voice transmissions from said one subscriber unit with stored voiceprint data that uniquely identifies a subscriber to whom said one subscriber unit is assigned; and\nmeans for enabling said cell origination if said voice transmission match said stored voiceprint data.\n14. In a cellular mobile telephone system, wherein a plurality of mobile telephone switching offices, each of which serves a plurality of cell sites for establishing cellular call connections with mobile subscriber units located in a geographical area covered by said cell sites, are connected to a subscriber verification system which validates the authorization of subscriber units, each of which is identified by a unique subscriber identification code assigned to said subscriber unit, to receive service when roaming outside to the subscriber's home mobile telephone switching office, a method operational in said subscriber verification system to detect subscriber information code cloning comprising the steps of:\nstoring, in response to one of said subscriber units originating a cellular call connection, data indicative of a subscriber unit identification code assigned to said one subscriber unit and real time call data associated with said cellular call connection; and\ndetecting a temporal anomaly indicative of subscriber number cloning in said stored call data.\n15.

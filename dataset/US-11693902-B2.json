    "abstract": "A system, computer readable storage medium, and computer-implemented method presents video search results responsive to a user keyword query. The video hosting system uses a machine learning process to learn a feature-keyword model associating features of media content from a labeled training dataset with keywords descriptive of their content. The system uses the learned model to provide video search results relevant to a keyword query based on features found in the videos. Furthermore, the system determines and presents one or more thumbnail images representative of the video using the learned model.",

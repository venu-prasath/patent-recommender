    "abstract": "A virtual reality application adaptively generates a virtual reality experience intended to improve a user's mood. A plurality of digital assets is stored together with associated scores. A score for a digital asset represents a predicted amount of mood improvement occurring in a cohort of users having similar profiles to a target user in response to virtual reality experiences including the digital asset. A customized virtual reality experience is generated for the target user based at least in part of the user profile data on the scores. The user's change in mood is detected through survey and/or biometric data. Scores for the digital assets may then be updated in order to further learn their respective effects on the cohort of users.",

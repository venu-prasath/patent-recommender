    "title": "Method and apparatus for dynamic data transfer on a web page",
    "abstract": "A system and method for transferring information resources over a network from one source to another that reduces latency and bandwidth requirements on the network. The information resources are made up of at least a static and dynamic portion. A client requests information, and a server receives the request and then transmits to the requestor the desired information. The server may send both the static and dynamic portion of the information resource, or the server may sent only the dynamic portion of the resource, depending on the client's needs and the request made. By discriminating between the static and dynamic portions of an information resource in this way, less data must be sent from the server to the client on every access. Also, the computational load that is typical of servers on a network is shifted to the client, thereby reducing latency.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for transferring over a network at least a portion of a resource having at least a template and a dynamic portion, comprising the steps of:\na. receiving a request from a client for at least the dynamic portion of the resource;\nb. sending the dynamic portion of the resource, the dynamic portion adapted to be combined with the template; and\nc. if said client lacks the template, then performing the sub-steps of:\ni. receiving a request for said template, and\nii. sending said template.\n2. The method of claim 1 wherein said resource is a HTML document.\n3. The method of claim 1 wherein an HTML extension relating to said resource contains at least one dynamic-variable tag.\n4. The method of claim 1 wherein an HTML extension relating to said resource contains a loop tag.\n5. The method of claim 1 wherein an HTML extension relating to said resource contains a tag used to define the dynamic part of the document.\n6. A computer readable medium that stores instructions adapted to be executed by a processor to perform the steps of:\na. receiving a request from a client for at least a dynamic portion of a resource, the resource including at least a template and a dynamic portion;\nb. sending the dynamic portion of said resource, the dynamic portion adapted to be combined with the template; and\nc. if the client lacks the template, then performing the sub-steps of:\ni. receiving a request for the template, and\nii. sending the template.\n7. A method for transferring over a network at least a portion of a resource having at least a template and a dynamic portion, comprising the steps of:\na. receiving a request from a client for at least a dynamic portion of the resource;\nb. sending the dynamic portion of the resource in response to the request for at least a dynamic portion of the resource, the dynamic portion adapted to be combined with the template; and\nc. after sending a dynamic portion of the resource,\ni. receiving a request for the template; and\nii. sending the template in response to the request for the template.\n8. The method of claim 7 wherein said resource is a HTML document.\n9. The method of claim 7 wherein an HTML extension relating to said resource contains at least one dynamic-variable tag.\n10. The method of claim 7 wherein an HTML extension relating to said resource contains a loop tag.\n11. The method of claim 7 wherein an HTML extension relating to said resource contains a tag used to define the dynamic part of the document.\n12. A method for transferring over a network at least a portion of a resource having at least a template and a dynamic portion, the method comprising:\n(a) receiving a request from a client for at least a dynamic portion of the resource;\n(b) sending, in response to the request, only the dynamic portion of the resource, the dynamic portion being adapted to be combined with the template; and\n(c) if the client lacks the template, then performing the sub-steps of:\n(i) receiving a request for the template, and\n(ii) sending the template.\n13. A method for transferring over a network at least a portion of a resource having at least a template and a dynamic portion, the method comprising:\n(a) receiving a request from a client for at least the dynamic portion of the resource;\n(b) sending, in response to the request, the dynamic portion of the resource without sending the template, the dynamic portion being adapted to be combined with the template; and\n(c) if the client lacks the template, then performing the sub-steps of:\n(i) receiving a request for the template, and\n(ii) sending the template.",

    "abstract": "Systems and methods for identifying data of interest are disclosed. The system may retrieve unstructured data from an internet data source via an alert system or RSS feed. The system may input the unstructured data into various models and scoring systems to determine whether the data is of interest. The models and scoring systems may be executed in order or in parallel. For example, the system may input the unstructured data into a Na\u00efve Bayes machine learning model, a long short-term memory (LSTM) machine learning model, a named entity recognition (NER) model, a semantic role labeling (SRL) model, a sentiment scoring algorithm, and/or a gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT) machine learning model. Based on determining that the unstructured data is of interest, a data alert may be generated and transmitted for manual review or as part of an automated decisioning process.",

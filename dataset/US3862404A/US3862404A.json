    "title": "Device for carrying out two-dimensional interpolation in conjunction with a fixed word store",
    "abstract": "A device for use with a fixed word store for multidimensional interpolation of function values not stored in the store by adding stored functional support values which surround the desired value on a coordinate basis. Analog/digital converters and digital/analog converters cause analog signals to be received and emitted by the device which otherwise operates in a purely digital mode. As used with an internal combustion engine two fixed value stores may be rendered effective in separate calculating cycles to control respective engine control functions such as ignition and fuel injection.",

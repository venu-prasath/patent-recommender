    "abstract": "A building management system includes one or more memory devices configured to store instructions thereon, that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to receive a publication by an agent on an agent communication channel, the publication comprising timeseries data, identify, based on the publication, an object entity of an entity database associated with the agent, wherein the entity database includes one or more object entities and relationships between the one or more object entities and one or more data entities, identify a data entity related to the object entity based on a relationship of the relationships relating the object entity and the data entity, and ingest the timeseries data into the data entity.",
    "claims": "\n1. A building system of a building comprising one or more non-transitory storage devices, the one or more non-transitory storage devices storing a digital twin of the building thereon, wherein the digital twin comprises a contextual description of the building representing a plurality of entities of the building, wherein the digital twin includes a graph including a plurality of nodes representing the plurality of entities and a plurality of edges between the plurality of nodes representing relationships between the plurality of entities,\nwherein the one or more non-transitory storage devices have instructions stored thereon that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to:\nimplement an agent for at least one entity of the plurality of entities, wherein the agent performs one or more operations on at least a portion of the digital twin to generate one or more operational settings associated with the at least one entity; and\ningest, by the agent, the one or more operational settings into the digital twin by identifying a node of the plurality of nodes related to a second node of the plurality of nodes representing the at least one entity of the plurality of entities and storing the one or more operational settings in the node.\n2. The building system of claim 1, wherein the agent is configured to perform a goal based optimization, wherein the one or more operational settings are a result of performing the goal based optimization.\n3. The building system of claim 1, wherein the agent is configured to:\nstore one or more channel subscriptions and one or more channel publication assignments;\nsubscribe to one or more channels based on the one or more channel subscriptions to receive first data published on the one or more channels by one or more other agents; and\npublish second data to the one or more channels based on the one or more channel publication assignments to publish the second data on the one or more channels to the one or more other agents.\n4. The building system of claim 1, wherein a type of the one entity is linked to a particular type of the agent.\n5. The building system of claim 1, the agent is configured to:\nreceive first data published on an agent communication channel by a second agent;\nidentify, based on the first data, second data of the digital twin; and\nexecute an algorithm based on the first data and the second data.\n6. The building system of claim 1, wherein the one or more non-transitory storage devices store a plurality of agent templates;\nwherein the instructions cause the one or more processors to:\ndetermine whether to instantiate the agent by analyzing the digital twin;\nselect an agent template from the plurality of agent templates in response to a determination to instantiate the agent; and\ninstantiate the agent based on the agent template.\n7. The building system of claim 1, wherein the agent is configured to:\nretrieve the portion of the digital twin associated with an algorithm executed by the agent; and\nexecute the algorithm based on the portion of the digital twin to generate the one or more operational settings.\n8. The building system of claim 1, wherein the building system further comprises a device, wherein the device is configured to run the agent, wherein the device is at least one of a sensor, an actuator, or a controller.\n9. The building system of claim 1, wherein the instructions cause the one or more processors to run the agent.\n10. The building system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of entities of the building comprise at least one of building equipment, spaces, or people.\n11. A method of agent based digital twin processing, the method comprising:\ncausing, by one or more processing circuits, a storage device to store a digital twin of a building, wherein the digital twin comprises a contextual description of the building representing a plurality of entities of the building, wherein the digital twin includes a graph including a plurality of nodes representing the plurality of entities and a plurality of edges between the plurality of nodes representing relationships between the plurality of entities;\nimplementing, by the one or more processing circuits, an agent to execute for at least one entity of the plurality of entities, wherein the agent performs one or more operations on at least a portion of the digital twin to generate one or more operational settings associated with the at least one entity; and\ningesting, by the one or more processing circuits, the one or more operational settings into the digital twin by identifying a node of the plurality of nodes related to a second node of the plurality of nodes representing the at least one entity of the plurality of entities and storing the one or more operational settings in the node.\n12.

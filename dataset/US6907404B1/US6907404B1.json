The system includes a computer, a historical information database accessible by the computer having historical information for a plurality of investments stored thereon, a connection to a supply of real-time data, the real time data comprising real-time data relating to a plurality of investments, and a templates database accessible by the computer having a plurality of templates stored thereon. Software executing on the computer generates an investment chart for the investment to be examined based upon the historical information and the real-time data relating to the investment to be examined. Software executing on the computer then retrieves at least one template from the templates database, and performs geometric projection analysis on the retrieved template and the investment chart to determine if a pattern exists in the investment chart. Next, software executing on the computer retrieves at least one template from the templates database, and performs template matching analysis on the retrieved template and the investment chart to determine if a pattern exists in the investment chart. Software executing on the computer then performs projection line analysis on the investment chart to determine if a pattern exists in the investment chart.",

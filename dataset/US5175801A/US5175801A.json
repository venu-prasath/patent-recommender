    "title": "Method for carrying out fuzzy inference",
    "abstract": "An apparatus for carrying out fuzzy inference and a method therefor are disclosed in which an oblivescence coefficient is introduced and multiplied by a membership function of a conclusion portion in each operating variable linguistic control rule, the oblivescence coefficient being determined through a fuzzy inference according to an oblivescence element corresponding to a difference of times at which the linguistic control rule is established and at which it is used, and/or situations in which the linguistic control rule is established and in which it is used, and the determined oblivescence coefficient is used to vary a weight, or importance, of the linguistic control rule for the operation of the controlled object according thereto so that each linguistic control rule can flexibly be used to execute the fuzzy inference according to its used date, place, and object.",

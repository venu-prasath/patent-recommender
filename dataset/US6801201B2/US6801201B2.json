    "title": "Method for chart markup and annotation in technical analysis",
    "abstract": "A method for generating markup information and annotating a time series chart to display recognized pattern formations. Pivot points in the time series are identified and categorized. The pivot points are then analyzed to recognize desired pattern formations. The time series is then graphically displayed with the pivot points marked and labeled. Lines drawn between the pivot points display the recognized pattern to a user. Breakout (trend) lines can also be included. The time series can include time series of financial data, such as stock prices, medical data, such as electrocardiogram results, or any other data that can be presented as a time series, and in which it is desirable to identify turning points, trends, formations or other information.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for generating markup for annotating a chart of time series data, wherein a rich feature set of technical event data related to the time series data is stored in a database, the rich feature set including identification of pivot points in the time series data, pattern recognition data derived from the identified pivot points, and rating and quality assessments derived from the pattern recognition data, the identified pivot points and the time series data, the method comprising:\n2. The method of claim 1, further including, at the client, displaying the time series as a chart, and annotating the chart in accordance with the markup information.\n3. The method of claim 2, further including analyzing and manipulating the markup information at the client.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein the request specifies a desired format for the markup information.\n5. The method of claim 4, wherein the desired format is selected from XML, SOAP, MS Excel, and MS Word.\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein the features are selected in accordance with the request.\n7. The method of claim 1, wherein feature selection rules are predetermined in accordance with pattern type and time series data type.\n8. The method of claim 1, wherein the markup tags are determined according to markup rules based on pattern type and time series data type.\n9. The method of claim 1, wherein assembling the markup tags includes assembling the markup tags in a predetermined hierarchical structure.\n10. A method for generating markup for annotating a chart of time series data, wherein a rich feature set of technical event data related to the time series data is stored in a database, the rich feature set including identification of pivot points in the time series data, pattern recognition data derived from the identified pivot points, and rating and quality assessments derived from the pattern recognition data, the identified pivot points and the time series data, the method comprising:\n11. A method for annotating a time series chart, comprising:\n12. The method of claim 11, further including, at the client, displaying the chart, and annotating the chart in accordance with the markup information.\n13. The method of claim 12, further including analyzing and manipulating the markup information at the client.",

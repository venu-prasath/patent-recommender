    "abstract": "Methods, systems, and computer programs are presented for adding new features to a network service. An example method includes accessing an image from a user device to determine a salient object count of a plurality of objects in the image. A salient object count of the plurality of objects in the image is determined. An indicator of the salient object count of the plurality of objects in the image is caused to be displayed on the user device.",

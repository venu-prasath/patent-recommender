    "abstract": "Mechanisms are provided to perform embedding of content of a natural language document. The mechanisms receive a document data object of an electronic document and analyze a structure of the electronic document to identify one or more structural document elements that have a relationship with the document data object. A dependency data structure is generated, representing the electronic document, where edges define relationships between document elements and at least one edge represents at least one relationship between the one or more structural document elements and the document data object. The mechanisms embed the document data object based on the at least one relationship to thereby represent the document data object as a vector data structure. The mechanisms perform natural language processing on the portion of natural language content based on the vector data structure. The one or more structural document elements are non-local non-contiguous with the document data object.",

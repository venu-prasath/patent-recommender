    "title": "System and method for communication of information using channels of different latency",
    "abstract": "A system and method for communication of information using channels of different latency combine a high latency communication channel with a low latency communication channel to reduce the communication delay perceived by a user. The system and method includes separating information into first and second components based on a parameter correlated to the perceived delay, communicating the first component via a first channel, communicating the second component via a second channel having a communication delay greater than the first channel, and generating a representation of the information based on the first component. The second component of the information may be used to augment or modify the information represented by the first component. In one embodiment, the invention is applied to video teleconferencing where voice information and basis image information is transmitted via the low latency channel while background and other non-real-time information is communicated via the high latency communication channel.",

The method of claim 1 further comprising:\nmodifying the representation of the information based on the second component.\n3. The method of claim 1 further comprising:\nstoring the second component after reception for use in generating future representations of similar information.\n4. The method of claim 1 wherein the first component comprises a header transmitted to initialize a transaction.\n5. The method of claim 1 wherein the step of separating comprises separating the information based on frequency.\n6. The method of claim 1 wherein the information represents an image, the second component represents a previously stored image, and the first component represents a difference between the previously stored image and a current image.\n7. The method of claim 1 wherein the information represents an image sequence and wherein the at least one parameter corresponds to rate of change of the information corresponding to a predetermined position within each image of the sequence.\n8. The method of claim 6 wherein the second component represents a substantially stationary background image.\n9. The method of claim 1 wherein the information is generated by a game executing on a remote computer, the game including commands initiated by a player, responses initiated by the remote computer, and graphics representing various scenes of the game, the first component representing the commands and the responses, and the second component representing the graphics.\n10. The method of claim 1 wherein the information is generated by an application program executing on a remote computer and wherein the first component represents feedback in response to a command initiated by a user of the application program.\n11. The method of claim 9 wherein the step of generating a representation of the information comprises changing position of a cursor in response to movement of an input device.\n12. A system for providing wideband communication of information while reducing perceived latency between transmission and reception, the system comprising:\na first transmitter having an associated first communication channel characterized by a first communication latency;\na second transmitter having an associated second communication channel characterized by an associated second communication latency, the second communication latency being greater than the first communication latency;\na first encoder for generating a symbolic representation of the information;\na second encoder in communication with the first encoder for generating a bit stream representing the symbolic representation generated by the first encoder and control information; and\na router in communication with the second encoder and the first and second transmitters for directing a first portion of the bit stream to the first transmitter and a second portion of the bit stream to the second transmitter based on the control information;\nwherein the first transmitter transmits the first portion of the bit stream and the second transmitter transmits the second portion of the bit stream to provide wideband communication of the information while reducing the perceived latency.\n13.

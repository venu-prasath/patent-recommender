    "abstract": "Embodiments are directed to a machine learning engine that determines training documents and validation documents from a plurality of documents. The machine learning engine may determine attributes associated with the documents. In response to receiving a request to predict attribute values of a selected document the machine learning engine may train a plurality of ML models to predict the attribute values based on the training documents and the attributes and associate the trained ML models with an accuracy score. The machine learning engine may determine candidate ML models from the trained ML models based on the training accuracy scores. The machine learning engine may evaluate and rank the candidate ML models based on the request and the validation documents. The machine learning engine may generate confirmed ML models based on the ranked candidate ML models such that the confirmed ML models may answer the request.",

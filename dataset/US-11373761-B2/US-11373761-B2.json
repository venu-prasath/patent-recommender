    "abstract": "Various devices and methods are provided for machine learning-driven medical diagnostic testing. In one example, a method includes generating a patient-specific collaboration channel comprising a patient-specific dashboard and a communication thread between a care provider team monitoring a patient and a virtual healthcare assistant, storing, at the channel, text- and/or rich media-based messages on the communication thread between one or more care providers of the care provider team and the virtual healthcare assistant, at least a portion of the messages on the communication thread including patient-specific medical data, and responsive to a prompt, outputting at least a portion of the communication thread that includes the patient-specific medical data to a display device.",
    "claims": "\n1. A computing device comprising a display screen, the computing device being configured to display on the screen a collaborative system interface that includes a patient link for each of a plurality of patients, each patient link selectable to launch a communication thread for a patient of the plurality of patients, including a first patient link that when selected causes a first communication thread specific to a first patient of the plurality of patients to be displayed on the screen, the first patient link of the collaborative system interface including a notification that a new message is available to view on the first communication thread, the first communication thread including communication between a care provider and a lab virtual healthcare assistant regarding the first patient, the first communication thread including an identifier of the first patient displayed on the screen and multiple messages displayed on the screen between at least the care provider and the lab virtual healthcare assistant regarding the first patient, the multiple messages including the new message, the new message including diagnostic lab test information of the first patient, at least a portion of the displayed diagnostic lab test information within first the communication thread being selectable to launch a first dashboard specific to the first patient from an un-launched state and enable the selected diagnostic lab test information to be seen within the first dashboard along with additional information specific to the first patient, and wherein the first communication thread is displayed while the first dashboard is in the un-launched state.\n2. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the displayed diagnostic lab test information includes a notification that results of a diagnostic lab test are available, wherein the results are displayed within the dashboard, wherein the dashboard is displayed in response to a first type of user input applied to select the diagnostic lab test information within the first communication thread, and further comprising displaying, in response to a second type of user input applied to select the diagnostic lab test information within the first communication thread, a preview of the diagnostic lab test information without displaying the first dashboard.\n3. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the communication thread includes a first message including a request from the care provider for an estimated time until results are available for a diagnostic lab test ordered for the patient and a second message including the estimated time from the lab virtual healthcare assistant.\n4. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the communication thread includes a first message from the care provider including a request for the virtual healthcare assistant to provide one or more suggested lab tests to be conducted on the patient and a second message from the lab virtual healthcare assistant including one or more lab tests suggested by the lab virtual healthcare assistant.\n5. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the diagnostic lab information includes a priority ranking of a diagnostic lab test ordered for the patient, and wherein the lab virtual healthcare assistant is configured to adjust the priority ranking responsive to one or more current patient parameters reaching a predetermined condition, output an alert displayed in the dashboard indicating that the priority ranking has been updated, and send a message indicating the updated priority ranking to a lab system comprising one or more computing devices configured to execute a laboratory information system (LIS) that manages scheduling of a plurality of diagnostic lab tests.\n6. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the communication thread includes a first message from the lab virtual healthcare assistant including a notification that a diagnostic lab test for the patient has been ordered more than once, that the diagnostic lab test for the patient has not been ordered as expected, or that the diagnostic lab test for the patient has been ordered out of sequence with one or more other diagnostic lab tests."

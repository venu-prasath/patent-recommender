    "abstract": "Mechanisms are provided in which a first knowledge graph, comprising nodes representing entities and edges between nodes indicative of a relationship between the entities, is received. The mechanisms identify a candidate missing edge connecting a node of the first knowledge graph to another node not present in the first knowledge graph and evaluate the candidate missing edge to determine if the candidate missing edge should be added to the first knowledge graph. The mechanisms expand the first knowledge graph to include the candidate missing edge connecting the node to a newly added node that is newly added to the first knowledge graph, to thereby generate an expanded knowledge graph, in response to the evaluation indicating that the candidate missing edge should be added to the first knowledge graph. The mechanisms then perform an operation on the expanded knowledge graph to generate a knowledge output.",

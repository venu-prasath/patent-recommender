    "abstract": "Mechanisms are provided for performing a cognitive operation. The mechanisms receive an original graph data structure comprising nodes and edges between nodes and activity log information for nodes of the original graph data structure. The mechanisms identify a set of nodes in the original graph data structure having a predetermined pattern of activity in the activity log information, and a set of edges between these nodes. The mechanisms calculate an importance weight for each edge in the set of edges and modify the original graph data structure based on the calculated importance weights for the edges in the set of edges, to thereby generate a modified graph data structure. The mechanisms then perform a cognitive operation based on the modified graph data structure. The set of edges may comprise actual edges between the nodes and/or potential edges between the nodes.",

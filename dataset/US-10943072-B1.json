    "abstract": "Methods and systems are disclosed for an artificial intelligence (AI)-based, conversational insight and action platform for user context and intent-based natural language processing and data insight generation. Using artificial intelligence and semantic analysis techniques, a knowledge graph is generated from structured data, and a word embedding is generated from unstructured data. A semantic meaning is extracted from a user request, and at least one user attribute and context are determined. One or more entities and relationships on the knowledge graph that match the semantic meaning are determined, based on the user attribute, context, and the word embedding. A sequence of analytical instructions is generated from the matching results, and applied to the structured data to generate a data insight response to the user request. If no matches are found, similar entities and relationships are presented to the user, and user selections are used to further train the system.",

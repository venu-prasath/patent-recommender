    "abstract": "The invention includes a system, method and article of manufacture for generating a serendipity-weighted recommendation output set to a user based, at least in part, on a serendipity function. The system includes a processing system of one or more processors configured to receive applicable data that includes item recommendation data and community item popularity data. The processing system is also configured to produce a set of item serendipity control values in response to the serendipity function and the community item popularity data, and to combine the item recommendation data with the set of item serendipity control values to produce a serendipity-weighted and filtered recommendation output set. The method includes receiving applicable data by the processing system, including inputting item recommendation data and community item popularity data. The method further includes generating a set of item serendipity control values in response to the community item popularity data and a serendipity function, using the processing system, and combining the item recommendation data and the set of item serendipity control values to produce a serendipity-weighted and filtered item recommendation output set, also using the processing system. The invention also includes a computer readable medium having a having a set of program instructions physically embodied thereon, executable by a computer, to perform a method similar to the method described above.",

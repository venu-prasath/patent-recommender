    "abstract": "Athletic performance monitoring systems and methods, many of which utilize, in some manner, global positioning satellite (\u201cGPS\u201d) data, provide data and information to athletes and/or to equipment used by athletes during an athletic event. Such systems and methods may provide route information to athletes and/or their trainers, e.g., for pre-event planning, goal setting, and calibration purposes. Such systems and methods optionally may provide real time information to the athlete while the event takes place, e.g., to assist in reaching the pre-set goals. Additionally, data and information collected by such systems and methods may assist in post-event analysis for athletes and their trainers, e.g., to evaluate past performances and to assist in improving future performances.",
    "claims": "\n1. An athletic performance monitoring system, comprising:\na device configured to be worn by an athlete during an athletic event, the device comprising:\na user interface;\na sensor;\na non-transitory computer-readable medium comprising computer-executable instructions that when executed by a processor perform at least:\nreceiving, from the sensor, data relating to at least one physical characteristic of an athletic performance along a route during the athletic event;\nreceiving from the user interface, data related to at least one physiological characteristic of the athlete during the athletic event;\ncalculating difficulty ratings for one or more portions of the route based on the at least one physical characteristic and the at least one physiological characteristic;\ncalculating target split times for the portions of the route, based upon the calculated difficulty ratings;\nproducing a view of the route simultaneously displaying the target split times; and\noutputting the view to the user interface.\n2. The monitoring system of claim 1, wherein the view of the route is an animated view of the route, wherein a playback of the athletic performance between a first location and a second location of the route of the athletic event is set at a first playback speed, and wherein the first playback speed of the animated view of the route is based on, at least in part, a calculated difficulty rating between the first location and the second location.\n3. The monitoring system of claim 1, wherein the user interface is configured to receive input data relating to a route to be used during the athletic event.\n4. The monitoring system of claim 2, wherein the difficulty ratings are additionally based on a comparison of data associated with the route against data associated with one or more other routes taken by the athlete during one or more previous athletic performances and at least one criterion selected from the group consisting of: route length, elevation changes over the route, altitude of the route, temperature during the athletic performance, humidity during the athletic performance, wind speed during the athletic performance, and wind direction during the athletic performance, and a combination thereof.\n5. The monitoring system of claim 1, wherein the simultaneous displaying of information is conducted during the athletic event.\n6. The monitoring system of claim 1, wherein the simultaneous displaying of information is provided to the athlete during the athletic event.\n7. The monitoring system of claim 2, wherein the first playback speed is based on, at least in part, instantaneous speed or pace of the athlete between the first location and the second location during the athletic event.\n8. The monitoring system of claim 2, wherein the first playback speed is based on, at least in part, data related to the at least one physiological characteristic between the first location and the second location during the athletic event.\n9. The monitoring system of claim 1, wherein the at least one physiological characteristic comprises heart-rate data for the athlete.\n10. The monitoring system of claim 2, wherein the simultaneous displaying of information comprises a route marker configured to designate movement of the athlete between the first location and the second location along the route, wherein the non-transitory computer-readable medium comprises computer-executable instructions that when executed by a processor perform at least:\nbase, at least in part, a visual appearance of the route marker on at least one of the at least one physical characteristic and the at least one physiological characteristic of the athletic performance.\n11. The monitoring system of claim 10, wherein the route marker configured to designate the movement of the athlete between the first location and the second location along the route is based on a calculated difficulty rating.\n12. A computer-implemented method, comprising:\nreceiving data from a first sensor worn by an athlete comprising at least one physical characteristic of an athletic performance along a route during an athletic event;\nreceiving data from a user interface worn by the athlete comprising at least one physiological characteristic of the athlete during the athletic event;\ncalculating, with a processor, difficulty ratings for one or more portions of the route based on the at least one physical characteristic and the at least one physiological characteristic;\ncalculating, with the processor, target split times for the portions of the route, based upon the calculated difficulty ratings;\ngenerating, with the processor, a view of the route that simultaneously displaying the target split times; and\noutputting the view to a display device.\n13. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, wherein the view of the route is an animated view of the route, wherein a playback of the athletic performance between a first location and a second location of the route of the athletic event is set at a first playback speed, and wherein the first playback speed of the animated view of the route is based on, at least in part, a calculated difficulty rating between the first location and the second location.\n14. The computer-implemented method of claim 13, wherein the difficulty rating is calculated for one or more portions of the route based on the at least one physical characteristic and the at least one physiological characteristic.\n15. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, wherein the simultaneous displaying of information during the athletic event is conducted during the athletic event.\n16. The computer-implemented method of claim 13, wherein the first playback speed is based on, at least in part, instantaneous speed or pace of the athlete between the first location and the second location during the athletic event.\n17. The computer-implemented method of claim 13, wherein the first playback speed is based on data related to the at least one physiological characteristic.\n18. The computer-implemented method of claim 13, wherein the simultaneous displaying of information comprises a route marker configured to designate movement of the athlete between the first location and the second location along the route, wherein a visual appearance of the route marker is based on a comparison of data associated with the route against data associated with one or more other routes taken by the athlete during one or more previous athletic performances and at least one criterion selected from the group consisting of: route length, elevation changes over the route, altitude of the route, temperature during the athletic performance, humidity during the athletic performance, wind speed during the athletic performance, and wind direction during the athletic performance, and a combination thereof.\n19. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, wherein the simultaneous displaying of information comprises a route marker configured to designate movement of the athlete between a first location and a second location along the route, and\nwherein a visual appearance of the route marker is based on at least one physical characteristic and the at least one physiological characteristic.",

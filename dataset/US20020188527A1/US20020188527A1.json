    "abstract": "The present invention is directed to a system and method for managing online merchandising. In one embodiment, a hierarchical management system enables managers to define an online merchandising offer, and to establish rules regarding the offer. The manager then authorizes an operator who develops the online offer content using the offer management system. The completed offer cannot be posted online until predefined checks ensure the offer content conforms to the manager defined rules. Preferably, the online content is inserted into a Web page using a dynamic node that links to the offer management system, enabling the manager to exert real-time control of the offer content. In another embodiment, an existing Web site is enabled to include such online offers, by inserting a plurality of dynamic nodes into the Web page, such that when not actively displaying offer content, the dynamic nodes are minimized in size and not apparent to a user.",

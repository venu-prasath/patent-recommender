    "abstract": "A method of using browsing activity to identify fraudulent online or virtual applications includes receiving a virtual application over one or more radio frequency links, determining an applicant name on the virtual application, determining an IP address of a source computer from which the virtual application originated, determining an online browsing or search history associated with the IP address, determining whether the online browsing or search history indicates recent Internet searches for the applicant name, and, in response to determining that the online browsing or search history does indicate recent Internet searches for the applicant name, flagging the virtual application as fraudulent and generating an electronic alert indicating that the virtual application is fraudulent to facilitate identifying fraudulent virtual applications for goods or services.",
    "claims": "\n1. A computer-implemented method of identifying fraudulent online applications, the method comprising:\nreceiving, by a computer system, applicant data associated with an online application;\ndetermining, by the computer system, an IP address of a source computer associated with the online application;\ntraining a machine learning model to determine an online application fraud detection rule, based on historical online application data and corresponding online search activity;\ndetermining, by the computer system, using the online application fraud detection rule, whether online activity associated with the IP address indicates that the online application is potentially fraudulent; and\nin response to determining that the online activity indicates that the online application is potentially fraudulent, performing, by the computer system, a fraud mitigation action including at least one of:\nflagging the online application as potentially fraudulent; or\ngenerating an electronic alert indicating that the online application is potentially fraudulent.\n2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the online application includes a field or routine that records online browsing or searching activity of the source computer, and the method further comprises receiving a recorded online browsing or searching activity of the source computer along with the online application when the online application is submitted.\n3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the online application includes a field or routine that records social media searching activity of the source computer.\n4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the online application includes a field or routine that records Internet search engine searching activity of the source computer.\n5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the online application includes an IP address field of the source computer.\n6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the online application includes a field indicating a current GPS location of the source computer.\n7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, the method further comprising:\ndetermining whether the applicant data corresponds to an existing customer;\nbased on determining that the applicant data corresponds to an existing customer, receiving customer data from a source indicating a current customer location;\ndetermining whether the current customer location corresponds to a location of the source computer; and\nperforming the fraud mitigation action, based on determining that the current customer location does not correspond to the location of the source computer.\n8. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein determining the online activity associated with the IP address includes retrieving an online browsing or search history that is stored with or within the online application.\n9. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein determining the online activity associated with the IP address includes receiving, via a transceiver, the online activity over a radio link.\n10. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the online application is an application for financial services or products, a credit card application, or an application for auto, homeowners, or life insurance.\n11. A system comprising:\nat least one processor;\na non-transitory computer-readable media storing computer-executable instructions that, when executed, cause the at least one processor to perform operations comprising:\nreceiving applicant data associated with an online application;\ndetermining an IP address of a source computer associated with the online application;\ntraining a machine learning model to determine an online application fraud detection rule, based on historical online application data and corresponding online search activity;\ndetermining, using the online application fraud detection rule, whether online activity associated with the IP address indicates that the online application is potentially fraudulent; and\nin response to determining that the online activity indicates that the online application is potentially fraudulent, performing a fraud mitigation action including at least one of:\nflagging the online application as potentially fraudulent; or\ngenerating an electronic alert indicating that the online application is potentially fraudulent.\n12. The system of claim 11, wherein the online application includes a field or routine that records online browsing or searching activity of the source computer, and the operations further comprise receiving a recorded online browsing or searching activity of the source computer along with the online application when the online application is submitted.\n13. The system of claim 11, wherein the online application includes a field or routine that records social media searching activity of the source computer.\n14. The system of claim 11, wherein the online application includes a field or routine that records Internet search engine searching activity of the source computer.\n15. The system of claim 11, wherein the online application includes an IP address field of the source computer.\n16. The system of claim 11, wherein the online application includes a field indicating a current GPS location of the source computer.\n17. The system of claim 11, the operations further comprising:\ndetermining whether the applicant data corresponds to an existing customer;\nbased on determining that the applicant data corresponds to an existing customer, receiving customer data from a source indicating a current customer location;\ndetermining whether the current customer location corresponds to a location of the source computer; and\nperforming the fraud mitigation action, based on determining that the current customer location does not correspond to the location of the source computer.\n18. The system of claim 11, wherein determining the online activity associated with the IP address includes retrieving an online browsing or search history that is stored with or within the online application.\n19. The system of claim 11, wherein determining the online activity associated with the IP address includes receiving, via a transceiver, the online activity over a radio link.\n20. The system of claim 11, wherein the online application is an application for financial services or products, a credit card application, or an application for auto, homeowners, or life insurance."

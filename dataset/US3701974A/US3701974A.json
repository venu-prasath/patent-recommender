    "abstract": "A learning circuit of the type adapted to converge on a desired output in response to solution control signals. A number generator is provided for producing digital circuit input signals according to a predetermined probability distribution. A digital to analog converter converts the digital input signals to discrete analog input currents. Another digital to analog converter is responsive to digital solution control signals for producing discrete analog solution control currents. A digital counter has a digital counting signal input and an output comprising a digital voltage counter state feedback signal proportional to the count in the counter. An additional digital to analog converter is provided for converting the digital counter state feedback signal to a discrete analog feedback current. The input current, the solution control current and the feedback current are summed at a current node. The current node has a sum current output for driving an analog to digital converter which converts the sum current output to a digital voltage output. The digital voltage output constitutes the circuit output and is also applied to the digital voltage counting input of the digital counter.",

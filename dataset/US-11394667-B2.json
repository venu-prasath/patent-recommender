    "abstract": "Example systems and methods related to chatbot skills are described. In one implementation, a system initiates a session to create a new chatbot. The system receives a selection of a first chatbot skill associated with the new chatbot and a selection of a second chatbot skill associated with the new chatbot, where the first chatbot skill is different from the second chatbot skill. The system creates the new chatbot by importing the first chatbot skill and the second chatbot skill into the new chatbot.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method comprising:\ninitiating, by a bot management system, a session to create a new chatbot;\nreceiving a first selection of a first chatbot skill to be associated with the new chatbot, wherein the first chatbot skill includes a first set of instructions with at least one property having at least one placeholder value, wherein the instructions of the first chatbot skill define a first intent that determines how the new chatbot responds to user messages including a first keyword;\nreceiving a second selection of a second chatbot skill to be associated with the new chatbot, wherein the second chatbot skill is different from the first chatbot skill, wherein the second chatbot skill includes a second set of instructions defining a second intent that further determines how the new chatbot responds to user messages including a second keyword; and\ncreating, by the bot management system, the new chatbot by importing the first chatbot skill and the second chatbot skill into the new chatbot, wherein importing the first chatbot skill comprises replacing the at least one placeholder value in the first set of instructions of the first chatbot skill with at least one specified value.\n2. The method of claim 1, further comprising communicating, by the bot management system, the new chatbot to a system for execution.\n3. The method of claim 1, comprising:\nproviding a chatbot skills marketplace, wherein the chatbot skills marketplace is configured to receive the first selection of the first chatbot skill and the second selection of the second chatbot skill.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein the first set of instructions of the first chatbot skill defines a third intent that further determines how the new chatbot responds to user messages including a third keyword.\n5. The method of claim 1, wherein the first intent further includes a data flow and a webhook, wherein the data flow and the webhook are configured to be performed in response to detecting the first keyword in the user messages.\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein the first set of instructions of the first chatbot skill defines a relationship between the first intent and the second intent.\n7. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving a selection of a third chatbot skill to be associated with the new chatbot, wherein the third chatbot skill includes a third set of instructions defining a third intent that determines how the new chatbot responds to user messages that include a third keyword, and wherein creating the new chatbot further includes importing the third chatbot skill.\n8. A method comprising:\ninitiating, by a bot management system, a session for a developer to create a new chatbot;\nreceiving, from the developer, a selection of a first chatbot skill from a chatbot skills marketplace to be associated with the new chatbot, wherein the first chatbot skill includes a first set of instructions with at least one property having at least one placeholder value, wherein the instructions of the first chatbot skill define a first intent that determines how the new chatbot responds to user messages that match the first intent;\nreceiving, from the developer, a selection of a second chatbot skill from the chatbot skills marketplace to be associated with the new chatbot, wherein the second chatbot skill is different from the first chatbot skill, and wherein the second chatbot skill includes a second set of instructions defining a second intent that further determines how the new chatbot responds to user messages that match the second intent;\nreceiving, from the developer, at least one input that corresponds to the at least one placeholder value of the first chatbot skill; and\ncreating, by the bot management system, the new chatbot by importing the first chatbot skill and the second chatbot skill into the new chatbot, wherein importing the first chatbot skill comprises replacing the at least one placeholder value in the first set of instructions of the first chatbot skill with the at least one input received from the developer.\n9. The method of claim 8, further comprising communicating, by the bot management system, the new chatbot to a system for execution.\n10. The method of claim 8, wherein the first set of instructions of the first chatbot skill defines a third intent that further determines how the new chatbot responds to user messages that match the third intent.\n11. The method of claim 8, wherein the first intent further includes a set of keywords, a data flow, and a webhook, wherein the data flow and webhook are configured to be performed in response to detecting at least one of the set of keywords in user messages.\n12. The method of claim 8, wherein the first set of instructions of the first chatbot skill defines a relationship between the first intent and the second intent.\n13. A bot management system comprising:\na communication manager configured to receive, from a communicatively coupled computing system of a developer, a first selection of a first chatbot skill to be associated with a new chatbot and receive a second selection of a second chatbot skill to be associated with the new chatbot, wherein the second chatbot skill is different from the first chatbot skill, wherein the first chatbot skill includes a first set of instructions defining a first intent that determines how the new chatbot responds to user messages and includes a first keyword, and wherein the second chatbot skill includes a second set of instructions defining a second intent that further determines how the new chatbot responds to user messages and includes a second keyword, wherein the first set of instructions includes a first property with a first placeholder value, the second set of instructions includes a second property with a second placeholder value, and wherein the communication manager is configured to receive, from the computing system of the developer, a first input that corresponds to the first placeholder value and a second input that corresponds to the second placeholder value; and\na bot building module configured to create the new chatbot by importing the first chatbot skill and the second chatbot skill into the new chatbot, wherein importing the first chatbot skill comprises replacing first placeholder value in the first set of instructions with the first input and replacing the second placeholder value in the second set of instructions with the second input.\n14. The bot management system of claim 13, wherein the communication manager is further configured to communicate the new chatbot to another system for execution.\n15. The bot management system of claim 13, wherein the first set of instructions of the first chatbot skill defines a first dataflow and a first webhook of the first intent, wherein the first dataflow and the first webhook are configured to be performed in response to the first keyword being detected in user messages.\n16. The bot management system of claim 15, wherein the second set of instructions of the second chatbot skill defines a second dataflow and a second webhook of the second intent, wherein the second dataflow and the second webhook are configured to be performed in response to the second keyword being detected in user messages.\n17. The method of claim 1, wherein the first selection and the second selection are received from a developer of the new chatbot.\n18. The method of claim 17, comprising:\nbefore creating the new chatbot, receiving, from the developer, the at least one specified value that corresponds to the at least one placeholder value in the first set of instructions.\n19. The method of claim 1, wherein the first set of instructions of the first chatbot skill defines a relationship between the first and second intents and a webhook.\n20. The method of claim 8, wherein the first set of instructions of the first chatbot skill defines a relationship between the first and second intents and a webhook."

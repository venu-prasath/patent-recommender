    "abstract": "Methods, systems, and apparatus for performing speech recognition. In some implementations, acoustic data representing an utterance is obtained. The acoustic data corresponds to time steps in a series of time steps. One or more computers process scores indicative of the acoustic data using a recurrent neural network to generate a sequence of outputs. The sequence of outputs indicates a likely output label from among a predetermined set of output labels. The predetermined set of output labels includes output labels that respectively correspond to different linguistic units and to a placeholder label that does not represent a classification of acoustic data. The recurrent neural network is configured to use an output label indicated for a previous time step to determine an output label for the current time step. The generated sequence of outputs is processed to generate a transcription of the utterance, and the transcription of the utterance is provided.",

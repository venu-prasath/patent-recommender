    "title": "Machine control system employing a programmable machine function controller",
    "abstract": "A machine control system including a programmable machine function controller comprised of a logic processor and a data processor. The logic processor is responsive to first devices on a machine, e.g. limit switches and push buttons, for controlling second devices on the machine, e.g. motor starters and solenoids, in accordance with a program representing a desired machine operation. The data processor operates asynchronously with the logic processor but responds thereto for selecting programs of arithmetic instructions relating to the machine operation. The system includes a panel of push buttons, lights and read-outs located remotely from the controller. Signals are transmitted between the controller and the panel using asynchronously operating receiver/transmitters which multiplex and transfer the signals on a serial basis. The machine includes at least one movable member in mechanical communication with a driving mechanism. The controller employs circuits which are responsive to the data processor and logic processor for producing signals to the driving mechanism to control the motion of the movable element.",

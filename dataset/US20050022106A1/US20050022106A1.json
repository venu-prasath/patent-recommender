    "abstract": "A system and method for providing efficient document scoring of concepts within a document set is described. A frequency of occurrence of at least one concept within a document retrieved from the document set is determined. A concept weight is analyzed reflecting a specificity of meaning for the at least one concept within the document. A structural weight is analyzed reflecting a degree of significance based on structural location within the document for the at least one concept. A corpus weight is analyzed inversely weighing a reference count of occurrences for the at least one concept within the document. A score associated with the at least one concept is evaluated as a function of the frequency, concept weight, structural weight, and corpus weight.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning classification models which are robust against label noise are provided. Noise may be modelled explicitly by modelling \u201clabel flips\u201d, where incorrect binary labels are \u201cflipped\u201d relative to their ground truth value. Distributions of label flips may be modelled as prior and posterior distributions in a flexible architecture for machine learning systems. An arbitrary classification model may be provided within the system. The classification model is made more robust to label noise by operation of the prior and posterior distributions. Particular prior and approximating posterior distributions are disclosed.",

Among other things, provided herein are methods, systems, components, processes, modules, blocks, circuits, sub-systems, articles, and other elements (collectively referred to in some cases as the \u201cplatform\u201d or the \u201csystem\u201d) that collectively enable, in a single database and system, the development and maintenance of a set of universal contact objects that relate to the contacts of a business and that have attributes that enable use for a wide range of activities, including sales activities, marketing activities, service activities, content development activities, and others, as well as improved methods and systems for sales, marketing and services that make use of such universal contact objects.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method, comprising:\nreceiving a set of customization parameters corresponding to a set of service features, wherein the set of service features includes a chat bot service feature, and wherein the set of customization parameters includes ticket parameters and a script used by a chat bot of a client-specific service system;\nconfiguring a client-specific service system data structure, comprising a ticket object definition that includes the ticket parameters, based on the set of service features and the set of customization parameters; and\nexecuting the client-specific service system based on the client-specific service system data structure for providing the set of service features to process tickets according to a ticket pipeline defined using the ticket parameters, wherein the tickets are instantiated from the ticket object definition.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein the ticket parameters include a set of custom ticket attributes and a ticket pipeline definition.\n3. The method of claim 2, wherein the ticket pipeline definition defines a plurality of pipeline stages of the ticket pipeline, and wherein the method comprises:\nassociating a set of condition with a pipeline state such that a ticket satisfying the set of conditions is moved to the pipeline stage.\n4. The method of claim 3, wherein the executing the client-specific service system comprises:\nexecuting a pipeline listening thread that listens for a ticket with attributes that satisfies a set of conditions assigned a pipeline stage of the ticket pipeline, wherein the pipeline listening thread adds the ticket to the pipeline stage and updates an attribute status of the ticket with a value that indicates the pipeline stage based upon the pipeline listening thread identifying the ticket.\n5. The method of claim 1, wherein the ticket object definition comprises a set of default ticket attributes and a status attribute that indicates a current pipeline stage of a ticket.\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein the set of customization parameters include a workflow definition that defines a set of workflow conditions of a workflow and actions that are executed with respect to a ticket based upon the set of workflow conditions being satisfied by attributes of the ticket.\n7. The method of claim 6, wherein executing the client-specific service system comprises:\nexecuting a workflow listening thread that listens for a ticket with attributes that satisfy the set of workflow conditions of the workflow definition, wherein the workflow listening tread executing the actions of the workflow definition based upon the workflow listening thread identifying the ticket.\n8. The method of claim 6, wherein the workflow definition is defined with respect to a stage of a ticket pipeline definition such that the actions are performed with respect to a ticket when the ticket is in the stage.\n9. The method of claim 6, wherein the workflow definition is defined independent of a ticket pipeline definition such that the actions are performed with respect to a ticket independent of which stage the ticket is in.\n10. A computer-implemented method comprising:\nreceiving a set of customization parameters corresponding to a set of service features, wherein the set of service features includes a chat bot service feature, and wherein the set of customization parameters includes ticket parameters and a script used by a chat bot of a client-specific service system;\nconfiguring a client-specific service system data structure, comprising a ticket object definition that includes the ticket parameters, based on the set of service features and the set of customization parameters; and\nexecuting the client-specific service system based on the client-specific service system data structure for providing the set of service features to process tickets according to a ticket pipeline defined using the ticket parameters, wherein the tickets are instantiated from the ticket object definition.\n11. The method of claim 10, wherein the set of customization parameters comprises a set of custom ticket attributes that are included in the ticket object definition and a ticket pipeline definition for defining the ticket pipeline.\n12. The method of claim 11, wherein the ticket pipeline definition defines a plurality of pipeline stages of the ticket pipeline, and wherein the method comprises:\nassociating a set of condition with a pipeline state such that a ticket satisfying the set of conditions is moved to the pipeline stage.\n13. The method of claim 11, wherein the set of customization parameters include a workflow definition that defines a set of workflow conditions of a workflow and actions that are executed with respect to a ticket based upon the set of workflow conditions being satisfied by attributes of the ticket.\n14. A computing system including one or more processors and one or more memories configured to perform operations comprising:\nreceiving a set of customization parameters corresponding to a set of service features, wherein the set of service features includes a chat bot service feature, and wherein the set of customization parameters includes ticket parameters and a script used by a chat bot of a client-specific service system;\nconfiguring a client-specific service system data structure, comprising a ticket object definition that includes the ticket parameters, based on the set of service features and the set of customization parameters; and\nexecuting the client-specific service system based on the client-specific service system data structure for providing the set of service features to process tickets according to a ticket pipeline defined using the ticket parameters, wherein the tickets are instantiated from the ticket object definition.\n15. The system of claim 14, wherein the set of customization parameters include a workflow definition that defines a set of workflow conditions of a workflow and actions that are executed with respect to a ticket based upon the set of workflow conditions being satisfied by attributes of the ticket.\n16. The system of claim 15, wherein the actions comprise an action selected by the client from a set of predefined actions via a graphical user interface and a custom action that is defined by the client via the graphical user interface.\n17. The system of claim 14, wherein the set of service features includes a feedback system that collects feedback from a contact of the client and the set of customization parameters include a survey defined by the client.\n18. The system of claim 14, wherein the client-specific service system is configured to access microservices of a multi-client service platform.\n19. The system of claim 18, wherein the microservices comprise a conversation system for communicating with clients.\n20. The system of claim 14, wherein the client-specific service system includes a contact database that stores contact data relating to contacts of the client and a ticket database that stores ticket data relating to tickets initiated by a subset of the contacts of the client.\n21. The system of claim 20, wherein the contact database is shared with a customer-relationship management system of the client, such that the contact data is representative of an entire customer lifecycle.",

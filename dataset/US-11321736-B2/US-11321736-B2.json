    "abstract": "A system includes a set of crawlers that find and retrieve documents from an information network, an information extraction system, a knowledge graph storing nodes and edges that connect them, wherein each node represents a respective entity of a corresponding entity type of a plurality of entity types, and wherein the knowledge graph further stores event data relating to events detected by the information extraction system, a machine learning system that trains models that are used in connection with at least one of entity extraction, event extraction, recipient identification, and content generation, a lead scoring system that scores the relevance of information to an individual and references information in the knowledge graph, and a content generation system that generates content of a personalized message to a recipient who is an individual for which the lead scoring system has determined a threshold level of relevance.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method comprising:\nobtaining, by a processing system, a recipient profile indicating one or more attributes of an ideal recipient of a message to be sent on behalf of a user;\nobtaining, by the processing system, message data indicating one or more of an objective of the message and a message template that comprises content to be included in the message;\ndetermining, by the processing system, a recipient list based on the recipient profile and a knowledge graph that stores:\nentity data relating to a plurality of entities, each entity being of a particular entity type of a plurality of different entity types and having one or more entity attributes that are stored in the knowledge graph, wherein the plurality of different entity types include business entities and individual entities,\nrelationship data relating to a plurality of relationships, each relationship being of a particular relationship type of a plurality of relationship types, wherein at least a subset of the plurality of relationships represent relationships between two entities,\nevent data relating to a plurality of detected events relating to entities and the plurality of relationships represented in the knowledge graph,\nwherein the recipient list identifies one or more individuals that are more likely to result in a successful outcome given the recipient profile and information represented in the knowledge graph;\nfor each individual in the recipient list:\ngenerating, by the processing system, a personalized message that is personalized to each individual based on one or more of the entity data, the relationship data, and the event data; and\nproviding, by the processing system, the personalized message via a communication network;\nafter providing the personalized message for each individual in the recipient list, receiving, by the processing system, one or more digital documents obtained from crawling a public source by one or more crawlers;\nextracting, by the processing system, a new entity from the one or more digital documents obtained from the crawling;\nextracting, by the processing system, a new relationship relating to the new entity and a previous entity based on the one or more digital documents obtained from the crawling and the knowledge graph, the previous entity being represented in the knowledge graph by a previous node; and\nupdating, by the processing system, the knowledge graph with a new node representing the new entity and a new edge corresponding to the new relationship, wherein the new edge connects the new node to the previous node.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein providing the personalized message comprises transmitting the personalized message to an account associated with each individual.\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein providing the personalized message comprises transmitting the personalized message to a client device of the user.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein the knowledge graph stores a plurality of nodes and a plurality of edges that connect respective nodes from the plurality of nodes, wherein each node represents a respective entity of a respective entity type and each edge corresponds to a respective relationship of a respective relationship type.\n5. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nextracting, by the processing system, a new event corresponding to the new entity, wherein extracting the new relationship is further based on the new event.\n6. The method of claim 5, wherein the new event is extracted using an event classification model that is trained to identify events indicated in documents.\n7. The method of claim 5, wherein the new relationship is extracted using an inference engine.\n8. The method of claim 1, wherein the new entity is extracted using an entity classification model that is trained to identify entities indicated in documents.\n9. The method of claim 1, wherein obtaining the recipient profile comprises receiving the recipient profile from a client device associated with the user.\n10. The method of claim 1, wherein obtaining the recipient profile comprises determining the one or more attributes of the ideal recipient based on the objective of the message and on historical data relating to outcomes associated with previously sent messages generated to achieve the objective of the message.\n11. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the recipient list comprises filtering entities from the plurality of entities represented in the knowledge graph based on the one or more attributes.\n12. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the recipient list comprises, for each individual of a subset of the one or more individuals represented in the knowledge graph, determining a lead score of each individual based on the one or more attributes of the recipient profile using a machine-learned scoring model.\n13. The method of claim 12, wherein the lead score of each individual is further based on an event related to each individual and/or an organization of each individual.\n14. The method of claim 12, wherein the lead score of each individual is further based on entity data relating to each individual and/or an organization of each individual.\n15. The method of claim 12, wherein the lead score of each individual is further based on relationship data relating to each individual and/or an organization of each individual.\n16. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the personalized message for an individual comprises:\nretrieving the entity data from the knowledge graph, wherein the entity data relates to the individual or an organization of the individual;\ngenerating directed content based on the retrieved entity data, wherein the directed content comprises at least a phrase or sentence that comprises information corresponding to the retrieved entity data; and\ngenerating the personalized message based on the directed content and the message template.\n17. The method of claim 16, wherein the directed content is generated based on a machine-learned generative model that is trained to generate text given entity data of an entity and a particular objective of the personalized message.\n18. The method of claim 17, wherein the machine-learned generative model is trained to generate text that is most likely to result in a successful outcome for the personalized message.\n19. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the personalized message for an individual comprises:\nretrieving the event data from the knowledge graph, wherein the event data relates to an event that occurred with respect to the individual or an organization of the individual;\ngenerating directed content based on the retrieved event data, wherein the directed content comprises at least a phrase or sentence that comprises information corresponding to the retrieved event data; and\ngenerating the personalized message based on the directed content and the message template.\n20. The method of claim 19, wherein the directed content is generated based on a machine-learned generative model that is trained to generate text given a particular objective of the personalized message and the event data relating to a known event that occurred with respect to an entity and the particular objective of the personalized message.\n21. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more digital documents crawled by the one or more crawlers include documents obtained from public internet websites.\n22. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nseeding the one or more crawlers with a set of resource identifiers from which to obtain the one or more digital documents.\n23. The method of claim 1, wherein the processing system uses natural language processing to extract the new entity from the one or more digital documents obtained from the crawling.",

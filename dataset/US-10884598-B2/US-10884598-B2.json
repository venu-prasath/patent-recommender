    "abstract": "The present disclosure relates generally to techniques for monitoring and improving a bot system. An analytic system is integrated with a bot system for monitoring, analyzing, visualize, and improving the performance of the bot system. The analytic system monitors events occurred in conversations between end users and the bot system, aggregates and analyzes the collected events, and provides information regarding the conversations graphically on a graphic user interface at different generalization levels. The analytic system can also provide suggestions, options, or other information for improving the bot system through the graphic user interface.",
    "claims": "\n1.

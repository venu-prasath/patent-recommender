    "abstract": "An integrated circuit includes circuitry to control a process. The process includes adjusting fuzzy-logic control parameters based on received and retrieved blood glucose-related data, predicting blood glucose levels based on the received blood-glucose-related data, and generating control signals to control dispensing of insulin based on the received blood glucose-related data and the fuzzy-logic control parameters. The process may include predicting blood glucose levels based on the retrieved blood glucose-related data. The process may include transitioning between a post-meal correction protocol and a fasting protocol. The process may include transitioning from a post-meal correction protocol to a fasting protocol when a fasting criteria is satisfied.",
    "claims": "\n1. An integrated circuit including circuitry to control a process, the process comprising:\nadjusting fuzzy-logic control parameters based on blood-glucose-related data;\npredicting blood glucose levels based on the blood-glucose-related data; and\ngenerating control signals to control dispensing of insulin based on the blood glucose-related data and the fuzzy-logic control parameters.\n2. The integrated circuit of claim 1 wherein the process comprises predicting blood glucose levels based on the blood-glucose-related data.\n3. The integrated circuit of claim 1 wherein the process comprises selectively transitioning between a post-meal correction protocol and a fasting protocol.\n4. The integrated circuit of claim 1 wherein the process comprises transitioning from a post-meal correction protocol to a fasting protocol when a fasting criteria is satisfied.\n5. The integrated circuit of claim 1 wherein the process comprises transitioning from a fasting protocol to a post-meal correction protocol when a prandial event is detected.\n6. The integrated circuit of claim 1 wherein the process comprises transitioning from a fasting protocol to a user-input protocol when a prandial event is detected.\n7. The integrated circuit of claim 1 wherein the fuzzy-logic control parameters comprise fuzzy-logic multipliers.\n8. The integrated circuit of claim 1 wherein the predicting blood glucose levels comprises predicting a subsequent blood glucose level based on a previously predicted blood glucose level.\n9. The integrated circuit of claim 1 wherein the process comprises implementing at least one of a neural network and a dynamic Bayesian network.\n10. The integrated circuit of claim 1 wherein the circuitry comprises a memory storing instructions, and the integrated circuit, in operation, executes the instructions.",

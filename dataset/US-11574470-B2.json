    "abstract": "Implementations relate to causing a command to be executed based on an image. In some implementations, a computer-implemented method includes obtaining and programmatically analyzing an image to determine suggested actions. The method causes a user interface to be displayed that includes user interface elements corresponding to default actions, and to suggested actions that are determined based on analyzing the image. The method receives user input indicative of selection of a particular action from the default actions and the suggested actions. The method causes a command to be executed by a computing device for the particular action that was selected.",

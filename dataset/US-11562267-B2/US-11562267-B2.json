    "abstract": "The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for an intelligent assistant (e.g., a chatbot) that can be used to enable a user to generate a machine learning system. Techniques can be used to automatically generate a machine learning system to assist a user. In some cases, the user may not be a software developer and may have little or no experience in either machine learning techniques or software programming. In some embodiments, a user can interact with an intelligent assistant. The interaction can be aural, textual, or through a graphical user interface. The chatbot can translate natural language inputs into a structural representation of a machine learning solution using an ontology. In this way, a user can work with artificial intelligence without being a data scientist to develop, train, refine, and compile machine learning models as stand-alone executable code.",

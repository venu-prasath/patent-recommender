    "title": "Numerical control system for machines utilizing a programmable sequence controller",
    "abstract": "A numerical control system utilizes a programmable sequence controller as a data transmitter for transmitting numerical control data from a digital computer to machine controllers associated with numerically controlled machine tools. The digital computer converts each of the least units of the numerical control data to a predetermined number of output commands and, upon request, transfers the output commands along with address codes to the sequence controller which has an input-output circuit connected at its output terminals with data input terminals of the machine controllers, so that by selectively setting and resetting the output terminals designated by the address codes, the sequency controller can supply the numerical control data to any one of the machine controllers.",

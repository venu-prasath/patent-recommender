    "abstract": "A system and method for analyzing a data store of de-identified patient data to generate one or more dynamic user interfaces usable to predict an expected response of a particular patient population or cohort when provided with a certain treatment. The automated analysis of patterns occurring in patient clinical, molecular, phenotypic, and response data, as facilitated by the various user interfaces, provides an efficient, intuitive way for clinicians to evaluate large data sets to aid in the potential discovery of insights of therapeutic significance.",

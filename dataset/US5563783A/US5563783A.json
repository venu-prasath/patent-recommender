    "title": "Method and system for securities pool allocation",
    "abstract": "Trading in pooled securities (e.g., pooled mortgages) requires allocation of securities from pools to contracts subject to certain rules or constraints. To improve upon manual allocation procedures, computer techniques for fast and profitable allocation have been developed. Advantageously, a locally optimal allocation can be found by a rule-based greedy algorithm, and the locally optimal allocation can be improved upon further by a simulated annealing technique which is more likely to produce a globally optimal allocation.",

    "claims": "\n1. A computer-implemented method for allocation of securities from a plurality of security pools to a plurality of contracts, the allocation being subject to a plurality of constraints and to optimization of an objective function, comprising:\ninputting to a computerized rule-based system a first representation of securities pool information, a second representation of contract information, a third representation of constraint information, and a fourth representation of control information,\ngenerating, as a first allocation with a first objective function value, for a sequence of allocations with corresponding objective function values, an initial allocation of securities satisfying the constraints and having an initial objective function value,\niteratively generating at least one further allocation in the sequence of allocations, the further allocation satisfying the constraints and having a further objective function value which is improved as compared with a preceding allocation in the sequence of allocations, and\ndisplaying the further allocation as a last allocation if a stopping criterion is satisfied.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first allocation of the sequence is an empty allocation.\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein the value of the objective function for the last allocation of the sequence differs from the value of the objective function for a preceding allocation by less than a predetermined amount.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein one of the sequence of allocations differs from a preceding allocation in the sequence by an amount allocated from a single one of the securities pools.\n5. The method of claim 1, wherein one of the sequence of allocations differs from a preceding allocation in the sequence by amounts allocated from more than one of the securities pools.\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein each securities pool consists of mortgage-backed securities.\n7. The method of claim 6, wherein one of the sequence of allocations differs from a preceding allocation in the sequence by a sum of money.\n8. The method of claim 6, wherein one of the allocations uses up the exact amount remaining in a pool.\n9. The method of claim 6, wherein a sum of money is allocated as a sum from two of the plurality of securities pools.\n10. The method of claim 6, wherein a sum of money is allocated as a sum from three of the plurality of securities pools.\n11. The method of claim 6, wherein forming a sum of money comprises splitting one of the plurality of securities pools.\n12. The method of claim 6, further comprising a step of exchanging a sum of money from one of the plurality of contracts with a sum of money from another one of the plurality of contracts.\n13. A computer system for allocation of securities from a plurality of securities pools to a plurality of contracts, the allocation being subject to a plurality of constraints and to optimization of an objective function, comprising:\ninput means for inputting a first representation of securities pool information, a second representation of contract information, a third representation of constraint information, and a fourth representation of control information,\nrule-based processing means:\nfor generating, as a first allocation with a first objective function value, for a sequence of allocations with corresponding objective function values, an initial allocation of securities satisfying the constraints and having an initial objective function value, and\nfor iteratively generating at least one further allocation in the sequence of allocations, the further allocation satisfying the constraints and having a further objective function value which is improved as compared with a preceding allocation in the sequence of allocations, and\ndisplay means for displaying the further allocation as a last allocation if a stopping criterion is satisfied.\n14. A computer-implemented method for allocation of securities from a plurality of securities pools to a plurality of contracts, assignment being subject to a plurality of constraints and to optimization of an objective function, comprising\ninputting to a computerized system a first representation of securities pool information, a second representation of contract information, a third representation of constraint information, and a fourth representation of control information, and\ngenerating a decreasing sequence of positive parameter values, and a corresponding sequence of allocations, comprising choosing each one of the sequence of allocations either (i) as providing an improved value of the objective function as compared with a preceding allocation in the sequence, or (ii) as passing a probabilistic acceptance test for a probability associated with the allocation which is directly related to the corresponding parameter value, and indirectly related to the magnitude of the difference of the value of the objective function of the allocation and the value of the objective function of a preceding allocation in the sequence, and\ndisplaying a final allocation when a stopping criterion is met.\n15. The method of claim 14, wherein the sequence of parameter values has a first value for which the probabilistic acceptance test is passed by a predetermined minimum number of allocations produced by a chosen procedure for generating allocations.\n16. The method of claim 14, wherein the sequence of allocations has a first allocation whose determination comprises:\ninputting to a computerized rule based system the first representation of securities pool information, the second representation of contract information, and the third representation of constraint information, and\ngenerating a sequence of securities allocations each of which satisfies the constraints, and each of which provides an improved objective function value as compared with a preceding securities allocation in the sequence.\n17. The method of claim 14, wherein one of the sequence of allocations differs from a preceding allocation in the sequence with respect to one contract and at most two pools.\n18. The method of claim 14, wherein each one of the sequence of parameter values is obtained from a preceding parameter value in the sequence by multiplication of the preceding parameter value with a constant in the range from 0.8 to 0.95.\n19. The method of claim 14, wherein the sequence of allocations is terminated when, for a last parameter value, none of a predetermined number of attempted allocations passed the probabilistic acceptance test.\n20. The method of claim 14, wherein the sequence of allocations is terminated when the objective function of an allocation is acceptable by comparison with a preset value.\n21. The method of claim 14, wherein the sequence of allocations is terminated when computer processing has reached a preset time limit.\n22. The method of claim 14, wherein the sequence of allocations is terminated by human intervention.\n23. A computer system for allocation of securities from a plurality of securities pools to a plurality of contracts, the allocation being subject to a plurality of constraints and to optimization of an objective function, comprising\ninput means for inputting to a computerized system a first representation of securities pool information, a second representation of contract information, a third representation of constraint information, and a fourth representation of control information, and\nprocessing means for generating a decreasing sequence of positive parameter values, and a corresponding sequence of allocations, each allocation being chosen either (i) as providing an improved value of the objective function as compared with a preceding allocation in the sequence, or (ii) as passing a probabilistic acceptance test for a probability associated with the allocation which is directly related to the corresponding parameter value, and indirectly related to the magnitude of the difference of the value of the objective function of the allocation and the value of the objective function of a preceding allocation in the sequence, and\ndisplay means for displaying a final allocation when a stopping criterion is met.",

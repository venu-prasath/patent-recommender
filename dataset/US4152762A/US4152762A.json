    "title": "Associative crosspoint processor system",
    "abstract": "Herein described is an information retrieval system for identifying and retrieving recorded information from a mass storage system for use in a central processing system. The described system is an associative crosspoint processor system having an input which communicates with and receives stored information from the mass storage system (e.g. magnetic tape, magnetic or optical disk, etc.) upon command from the central processing system. In the system a key momory stores key words which are then compared with data words stored in the mass storage system.",

    "title": "Data processing system with path disconnection and memory access failure recognition",
    "abstract": "A method is provided which controls a data processing system having two common memories forming a duplex memory, a plurality of clusters provided in common for the common memories, and input/output paths connecting the clusters to the common memories. The method includes the steps of detecting a failure which has occurred in one of the common memories by each of the clusters, physically disconnecting input/output paths connected to the above-mentioned one of the common memories therefrom when the failure is detected by one of the clusters, and inhibiting the clusters from accessing the above-mentioned one of the common memories in which the failure has occurred. There is also provided a data processing system that uses such a method.",

    "claims": "\n1. A data processing system, comprising:\nat least one common memory;\nclusters, each accessing said common memory;\ninput/output paths connecting said common memory and said clusters; and\ninput/output path disconnecting means for physically disconnecting said input/output paths from said common memory,\neach of said clusters comprising:\ninput/output path disconnection processing means for controlling said input/output path disconnecting means to physically disconnect, when a failure has occurred in one of said clusters, all input/output paths connected to said one of the clusters; and\ncluster failure recognition processing means for stopping operation of said one of the clusters when said one of the clusters in which said failure has occurred recognizes that said failure has occurred in said one of the clusters responsive to detection of the physical disconnection via an attempted access of said common memory.\n2. A data processing system as claimed in claim 1, wherein each of said clusters further comprises state supervising means for supervising states of other clusters and for judging whether each of the other clusters is normally operating.\n3. A data processing system as claimed in claim 2, wherein said state supervising means of each of said clusters periodically supervises the states of the other clusters.\n4. A data processing system, comprising:\ncommon memories;\nclusters, each accessing said common memories;\ninput/output paths connecting said common memories and said clusters; and\ninput/output path disconnecting means for physically disconnecting input/output paths from said common memories,\neach of said clusters comprising:\ninput/output path disconnection processing means for controlling said input/output path disconnecting means to physically disconnect, when a failure has occurred in one of said clusters, all input/output paths provided between said common memories and said one of the clusters; and\ncluster failure recognition processing means for performing a predetermined process necessary to stop an operation of the one of said clusters and for stopping the operation of the one of said clusters when the one of said clusters in which said failure has occurred recognizes that said failure has occurred the one of said clusters responsive to detection of the physical disconnection via an attempted access of said common memories.\n5. A data processing system as claimed in claim 4, wherein each of said clusters further comprises state supervising means for supervising states of other clusters and for judging whether each of the other clusters is normally operating.\n6. A data processing system as claimed in claim 5, wherein said state supervising means periodically supervises the states of the other clusters.\n7. A method for controlling a data processing system which has at least one common memory, clusters provided in common for each common memory, and input/output paths connecting said clusters to said common memory, said method comprising the steps of:\neach cluster supervising states of others of said clusters;\nphysically disconnecting by a supervising cluster of input/output paths provided between said common memory and one of the clusters being supervised when a failure has occurred in said one of the clusters; and\nstopping an operation of said one of the clusters being supervised in which said failure has occurred by determining whether or not the input/output path extending from said one of the clusters has been disconnected from said common memory by the attempted accessing of said common memory, and stopping said one of the clusters in which said failure has occurred when it is determined that said input/output path extending from said one of the clusters has been disconnected from said common memory by the attempted accessing of said common memory.\n8. A method as claimed in claim 7, wherein said method further comprises the step of performing, before the step of stopping the operation, a predetermined process necessary for stopping the operation of said one of the clusters.",

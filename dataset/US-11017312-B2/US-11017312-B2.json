    "abstract": "Mechanisms for training a Question and Answer (QA) system are provided. The QA system receives a training question for processing by the QA system and processes the training question to generate an answer to the training question, from a portion of content. The QA system identifies a repeatable pattern of content present in the portion of content in association with the answer to the training question. The QA system applies the repeatable pattern of content to other portions of content to generate at least one additional training question and at least one additional entry in a ground truth data structure to thereby expand a set of training questions and expand the ground truth data structure. The QA system is then trained using the expanded set of training questions and expanded ground truth data structure.",

    "abstract": "In various examples, a generative model is used to synthesize datasets for use in training a downstream machine learning model to perform an associated task. The synthesized datasets may be generated by sampling a scene graph from a scene grammar\u2014such as a probabilistic grammar\u2014and applying the scene graph to the generative model to compute updated scene graphs more representative of object attribute distributions of real-world datasets. The downstream machine learning model may be validated against a real-world validation dataset, and the performance of the model on the real-world validation dataset may be used as an additional factor in further training or fine-tuning the generative model for generating the synthesized datasets specific to the task of the downstream machine learning model.",

    "abstract": "A product-demand production-control system and method stores past-product demand data during past time periods for use with other data to compute product demands in such manner that the past-product demand data is used to estimate the product demands in current and near-future time periods. The system measures and stores the product demand data for a plurality of predetermined time periods and a plurality of products, and preestimates the product demand for a plurality of products for near-future time periods. Product-demand estimates for current and near-future time periods are revised for a plurality of products in response to weighted emphasis or confidence regarding product demand data in time periods just prior to the current time period.",

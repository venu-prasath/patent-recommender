    "abstract": "A computer-implemented system includes a treatment apparatus manipulated by a patient while performing an exercise session and a patient interface that receives a virtual avatar. The patient interface presents the virtual avatar. The virtual avatar uses a virtual representation of the treatment apparatus to guide the patient through an exercise session. A server computing device provides the virtual avatar of the patient to the patient interface and receives a message pertaining to a trigger event. The message includes a severity level of the trigger event. The server computing device determines whether a severity level of the trigger event exceeds a threshold severity level, and responsive to determining the severity level of the trigger event exceeds the threshold severity level, replaces on the patient interface the presentation of the virtual avatar with a presentation of a multimedia feed from a computing device of the medical professional.",

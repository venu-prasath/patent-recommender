    "abstract": "A device receives a knowledge graph and an ontology for the knowledge graph, and receives a query for information associated with the knowledge graph. The device generates candidate responses to the query, and assigns scores to the candidate responses based on the knowledge graph. The device identifies a particular candidate response, of the candidate responses, based on the scores for the candidate responses, and determines, based on the knowledge graph, a neighborhood of the particular candidate response. The device generates knowledge graph embeddings for the neighborhood of the particular candidate response, and determines a particular neighborhood, with a smallest loss of quality, based on the knowledge graph embeddings. The device generates a reasoning graph based on the ontology and the particular neighborhood, and generates an explanation of the particular candidate response based on the reasoning graph. The device performs an action based the explanation of the particular candidate response.",

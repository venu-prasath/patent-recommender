    "abstract": "A financial advisory system and a user interface for such a system are provided. According to one embodiment, information regarding a retirement income goal of an individual is received. Multiple input values for corresponding decision variables are also received. The decision variables include an indication regarding a target retirement age for the individual, an indication regarding anticipated monetary contributions directed toward the retirement income goal and an indication regarding the individual's risk tolerance. A probability distribution dependent upon the decision variables is generated based on simulated market return scenarios and representing a set of possible future portfolio values based on the plurality of inputs. Finally, feedback regarding the likelihood of the individual achieving the retirement income goal is provided in view of the input values by graphically depicting one or more of the set of possible future portfolio values relative to a graphical indication of the retirement income goal.",

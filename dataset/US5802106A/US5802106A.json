    "title": "Method for rapid data rate detection in a packet communication environment without data rate supervision",
    "abstract": "A method for data flow rate detection useful with data flow rate control is introduced into a TCP packet communication environment which does not have data rate supervision by computing presumed speed based on latency between packets during the initial interchange of synchronization (SYN) packet and the acknowledgement (ACK) packet, presuming to know the initial length of each. This information may be utilized to determine potential rate of data flow for further use in making bandwidth allocation and rate enforcement decisions.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for detecting data rate of data packets in a digital data packet communication environment having a plurality of digital packet transmission stations interconnectable in a data path, wherein said data packet communication environment employs the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), wherein said data packet communication environment lacks explicit end-to-end data rate control, said method comprising the steps of:\ncausing a first digital packet transmission station at a remote first end to send a first synchronization packet to a second digital packet transmission station at a local second end in the regular course of requesting that a connection be established;\ncausing said second digital packet transmission station to send a second synchronization packet of known data length to said first digital packet transmission station at said second end in the regular course of establishing a connection;\nwaiting at said second digital packet transmission station for an acknowledgement packet;\nnoting time of arrival of said acknowledgement packet;\nwaiting at said second digital packet transmission station for receipt of a first data packet;\nnoting time of arrival of said first data packet and data length of said first data packet; thereafter\ndetermining an initial estimate of serialization speed by dividing the data length of the first data packet by the difference in time of arrival of said acknowledgement packet and time of arrival of said first data packet; and\nrecording said initial estimate of serialization speed for further use.\n2. A method for detecting data rate of data packets in a digital data packet communication environment having a plurality of digital packet transmission stations interconnectable in a data path, wherein said data packet communication environment employs the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), wherein said data packet communication environment lacks explicit end-to-end data rate control, said method comprising the steps of:\ncausing a first digital packet transmission station at a remote first end to send a first synchronization packet to a second digital packet transmission station at a local second end in the regular course of requesting that a connection be established;\ncausing said second digital packet transmission station to send a second synchronization packet of known data length to said first digital packet transmission station at said second end in the regular course of establishing a connection;\nwaiting at said second digital packet transmission station for an acknowledgement packet;\nnoting time of arrival of said acknowledgement packet;\nwaiting at said second digital packet transmission station for receipt of a first data packet;\nnoting time of arrival of said first data packet and data length of said first data packet;\ntiming from the sending of said second synchronization packet;\ndetermining a lower limit on serialization speed by dividing the sum of the data length of the synchronization packet and said acknowledgement packet by the time of arrival of said acknowledgement packet relative to the time of sending said second synchronization packet; and\nrecording said lower limit on serialization speed for further use.\n3.

A method for detecting data rate of data packets in a digital data packet communication environment having a plurality of digital packet transmission stations interconnectable in a data path, wherein said data packet communication environment employs the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), wherein said data packet communication environment lacks explicit end-to-end data rate control, and wherein said acknowledgement packet is inseparable from said first data packet said method comprising the steps of:\ncausing a first digital packet transmission station at a remote first end to send a first synchronization packet to a second digital packet transmission station at a local second end in the regular course of requesting that a connection be established;\ncausing said second digital packet transmission station to send a second synchronization packet of known data length to said first digital packet transmission station at said second end in the regular course of establishing a connection;\nwaiting at said second digital packet transmission station for an acknowledgement packet;\nnoting time of arrival of said acknowledgement packet;\nwaiting at said second digital packet transmission station for receipt of a first data packet;\nnoting time of arrival of said first data packet and data length of said first data packet; thereafter\nestimating latency by:\nfirst assuming zero latency;\ncalculating said serialization speed given an assumption of zero latency; thereafter\nsanitizing said serialization speed to a lower speed; and thereafter\nrecalculating said serialization speed given an assumption of latency at said lower speed; and thereafter\nrecording said estimates of latency along with said estimates of serialization speed.\n6. The method according to claim 5 further including:\nthereafter refining estimates of serialization speed by measuring amounts of data which is actually received per unit time.\n7. A method for controlling data rate of data packets in a digital data packet communication environment having a plurality of digital packet transmission stations interconnectable in a data path, wherein said data packet communication environment lacks explicit end-to-end data rate control and wherein said data packet communication environment employs the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), said method comprising the steps of:\ncausing a second digital packet transmission station at a local second end to initiate a first synchronization packet of known data length to request a connection to a first digital data packet transmission station at a remote first end in the regular course of requesting that a connection be established, while initiating timing from said request; thereby\ncausing said first digital packet transmission station at said remote first end to send a second synchronization packet of known data length to said second digital packet transmission station at said local second end in the regular course of establishing a connection;\ncausing said second digital packet transmission station to send an acknowledgement packet of known data length to said first digital packet transmission station at said second end while logging timing of each transmission and reception event;\ncausing said second digital packet transmission station to send a first data packet of known data length to said first digital packet transmission station at said second end;\nwaiting at said second digital packet transmission station for at least an acknowledgement and any data in a return packet;\nnoting time of arrival and size of said return packet; thereafter\ndetermining an initial estimate of serialization speed plus the invariant portion of round trip transit time by dividing the data length of the first data packet plus said return packet by their round trip transit time;\ndetermining a second estimate of serialization speed plus said invariant portion of said round trip transit time by comparing with an estimate of serialization speed derived from round trip transit time of said first synchronization packet and said second synchronization packet, given known data length of said first synchronization packet and said second synchronization packet; and\ncomparing said initial estimate with said second estimate to remove effects of said time invariant round trip transit time (invariant latency) in order to obtain the serialization speed; and\nrecording said serialization speed for further use.\n8.

    "title": "Speech signal processor",
    "abstract": "Speech analysis and synthesis invole analysis for sinusoidal components and pitch frequency, and synthesis by first phase-resetting to zero at pitch period all sine oscillater components, whether periodic for voiced speech, or at random period in accordance with a random code for unvoiced speech. As a result, the synthesized speech signal has the initial line spectrum spread due to pitch structure for better speech quality. Frequency modulation may also be used.",

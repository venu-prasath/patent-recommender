    "abstract": "An artificial intelligence problem is solved using an artificial intelligence memory graph data structure and a lexical database to identify supporting knowledge. A natural language input is received and classified into components. A starting node of an artificial intelligence memory graph data structure, which comprises one or more data nodes, is selected to begin a search for one or more supporting knowledge data nodes associated with the classified components. Starting at the starting node, the artificial intelligence memory graph data structure is searched using a lexical database to identify the one or more supporting knowledge data nodes. An artificial intelligence problem is identified and solved using the one or more identified supporting knowledge data nodes of the artificial intelligence memory graph data structure.",

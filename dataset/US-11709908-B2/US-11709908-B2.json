    "abstract": "In one embodiment, a method is illustrated as including defining a set of perspective objects capable of being placed onto a modified web page, monitoring parameters of a web page, the parameters including a number of times a current object is executed on the web page, using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm to determine a perspective object with a preferred Return On Investment (ROI), and selecting the perspective object to be placed onto the modified web page.",
    "claims": "\n1. A system, comprising:\na processor; and\na memory storing executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform operations comprising:\nreceiving a set of parsed content;\nupdating a decision tree based on the received set of parsed content to incorporate a new set of search queries corresponding to the set of parsed content;\ngenerating an optimization analysis for each of a set of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms contained within an AI library, each of the set of AI algorithms being used to optimize one of a first set of traffic optimizer modules;\nmodifying the updated decision tree by assigning each of the set of parsed content and a corresponding one of the first set of traffic optimizer modules as a node in the decision tree;\ntraversing the modified decision tree to select a second set of traffic optimizer modules; and\nproviding the second set of traffic optimizer modules for use to generate content for display as an optimized web page for a corresponding content request.\n2.

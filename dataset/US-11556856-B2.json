    "abstract": "A method for training an analytics engine hosted by an edge server device is provided. The method includes determining a classification for data in an analytics engine hosted by an edge server and computing a confidence level for the classification. The confidence level is compared to a threshold. The data is sent to a cloud server if the confidence level is less than the threshold. A reclassification is received from the cloud server and the analytics engine is trained based, at least in part, on the data and the reclassification.",

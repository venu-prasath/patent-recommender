    "abstract": "Methods, systems, and computer programs are presented for adding new features to a network service. A method includes receiving an image depicting an object of interest or selection of such an image. The selection acts an anchor for subsequently displayed item images.",
    "claims": "\n1. A system comprising:\none or more hardware processors; and\na non-transitory machine-readable storage medium including instructions that, when executed by at least one hardware processor, cause the at least one hardware processor to perform operations comprising:\naccessing, by the at least one hardware processor, at least one image depicting at least a portion of an object of interest;\ncausing display of a first plurality of images having respective first signatures, the first plurality of images each corresponding to at least one respective publication in a publication corpus, the signature of the at least one image having a signature similarity with respect to the first signatures that exceeds a first threshold similarity level; and\nresponsive to a selection of a selected image from the first plurality of images, causing display of a second plurality of images having respective second signatures, the second plurality of images each corresponding to at least one respective publication in a publication corpus, the second signature having a signature similarity with respect to the second signatures that exceeds a second threshold similarity level.\n2. The system of claim 1, wherein the first signatures comprise vector representations of the first plurality of images.\n3. The system of claim 1, the operations further comprising, based on the first signatures having binary vector representations, determining that the at least one image has a greater similarity with the first signatures of the first plurality of images is based on determining Hamming distances between the at least one image and the first plurality of images and between the at least one image and the other images.\n4. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one image is selected based on conversational text received by a chatbot executing on the at least one server.\n5. The system of claim 4, wherein the chatbot performs natural language recognition to convert the conversational text into a structured query that, upon execution, produces a search result corresponding to the at least one image.\n6. The system of claim 4, wherein the chatbot executes a sequence specification to build a context and determine the intent of the user and the structured query is enriched with a parameter corresponding to the intent.\n7. The system of claim 1, wherein the selection of the selected image is from a presentation of the first plurality of images uses a tiled format that represents a ranking of the first plurality of images and the display of the second plurality of images uses a tiled format that represents a ranking of the second plurality of images.\n8. A method comprising:\naccessing, by at least one processor of at least one server, at least one image depicting at least a portion of an object of interest;\ncausing display of a first plurality of images having respective first signatures, the first plurality of images each corresponding to at least one respective publication in a publication corpus, the signature of the at least one image having greater signature similarity with the first signatures of the first plurality of images corresponding to respective publications in the publication corpus than with second signatures of other images corresponding to other publications in the publication corpus; and\nresponsive to a selection of a selected image from the first plurality of images, causing display of a second plurality of images having respective second signatures, the second plurality of images each corresponding to at least one respective publication in a publication corpus, the second input signature of the selected image having greater signature similarity with the second signatures of the second plurality of images corresponding to respective publications in the publication corpus than with third signatures of other images corresponding to other publications in the publication corpus.\n9. The method of claim 8, wherein the first signatures comprise vector representations of the first plurality of images.\n10. The method of claim 8, further comprising, based on the first signatures having binary vector representations, determining that the at least one image has a greater similarity with the first signatures of the first plurality of images is based on determining Hamming distances between the at least one image and the first plurality of images and between the at least one image and the other images.\n11. The method of claim 8, wherein the at least one image is selected based on conversational text received by a chatbot executing on the at least one server.\n12. The method of claim 11, wherein the chatbot performs natural language recognition to convert the conversational text into a structured query that, upon execution, produces a search result corresponding to the at least one image.\n13. The method of claim 11, wherein the chatbot executes a sequence specification to build a context and determine the intent of the user and the structured query is enriched with a parameter corresponding to the intent.\n14. The method of claim 8, wherein the selection of the selected image is from a presentation of the first plurality of images uses a tiled format that represents a ranking of the first plurality of images and the display of the second plurality of images uses a tiled format that represents a ranking of the second plurality of images.\n15. A non-transitory machine-readable storage medium including instructions that, when executed by at least one processor of at least one machine, cause the at least one machine to perform operations comprising:\naccessing, by the at least one processor of the at least one machine, at least one image depicting at least a portion of an object of interest;\ncausing display of a first plurality of images having respective first signatures, the first plurality of images each corresponding to at least one respective publication in a publication corpus, the signature of the at least one image having greater signature similarity with the first signatures of the first plurality of images corresponding to respective publications in the publication corpus, than with other signatures of other images corresponding to other publications in the publication corpus; and\nresponsive to a selection of a selected image from the first plurality of images, causing display of a second plurality of images, the second plurality of images each corresponding to at least one respective publication in a publication corpus, the second input signature of the selected image having greater signature similarity with the second signatures of the second plurality of images corresponding to respective publications in the publication corpus, than with third signatures of other images corresponding to other publications in the publication corpus.\n16. The non-transitory machine-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the first signatures comprise vector representations of the first plurality of images.\n17. The non-transitory machine-readable storage medium of claim 15, further comprising, based on the first signatures having binary vector representations, determining that the at least one image has a greater similarity with the first signatures of the first plurality of images is based on determining Hamming distances between the at least one image and the first plurality of images and between the at least one image and the other images.\n18. The non-transitory machine-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the at least one image is selected based on conversational text received by a chatbot executing on the at least one server.\n19. The non-transitory machine-readable storage medium of claim 18, wherein the chatbot performs natural language recognition to convert the conversational text into a structured query that, upon execution, produces a search result corresponding to the at least one image.\n20. The non-transitory machine-readable storage medium of claim 18, wherein the chatbot executes a sequence specification to build a context and determine the intent of the user and the structured query is enriched with a parameter corresponding to the intent."

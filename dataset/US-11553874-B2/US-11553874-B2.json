    "abstract": "A system includes a computing device that includes a memory configured to store instructions. The system also includes a processor to execute the instructions to perform operations that include receiving data representing one or more images of dental information associated with a patient. Operations include adjusting the data representing the one or more images of dental information into a predefined format, wherein adjusting the data includes adjusting one or more visual parameters associated with the one or more images of dental information. Operations include using a machine learning system to determine a confidence score for one or more portions of the one or more images of dental information, and producing a representation of the determined confidence scores to identify one or more detected features present in the one or more images of dental information.",

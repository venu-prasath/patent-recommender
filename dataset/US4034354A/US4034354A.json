    "title": "Programmable interface controller for numerical machine systems",
    "abstract": "A programmable interface controller capable of assuming specific sequential control functions is disclosed. The disclosed controller is a slave device under the direct control of the numerical control computer and is effectively transparent to numerical control machine system. Upon a first command the interface controller receives and stores data from the numerical control computer. The stored data is processed in accordance with an internal program and the results of the processing temporarily stored therein. Upon a second command, the results of the processing are returned to the numerical control computer from where they are distributed via the systems bi-directional bus to the machine as well as to operating routines elsewhere in the numerical control system. The programmable interface controller performs Boolean and logic arithmetic on the data received from the numerical control computer and is capable of assuming the control functions of prior art magnetics as well as other sequential control functions normally performed by the numerical control computer.",

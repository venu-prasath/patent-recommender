    "abstract": "Techniques for analyzing and synthesizing complex knowledge representations (KRs) may utilize an atomic knowledge representation model including both an elemental data structure and knowledge processing rules stored as machine-readable data and/or programming instructions. One or more of the knowledge processing rules may be applied to analyze an input complex KR to deconstruct its complex concepts and/or concept relationships to elemental concepts and/or concept relationships to be included in the elemental data structure. One or more of the knowledge processing rules may be applied to synthesize an output complex KR from the stored elemental data structure in accordance with context information. Methods of populating an elemental data structure and methods of synthesizing complex KRs from the elemental data structure may rely on linguistic inference rules and/or elemental inference rules.",

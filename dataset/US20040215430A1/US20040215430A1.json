    "title": "Method and apparatus for discovering evolutionary changes within a system",
    "abstract": "An adaptive system modeling method is provided. A system model is generated by using data corresponding to an input features set selected by using a baseline significance signature of the system. A superset of the input features and other features also is selected by using the baseline significance signature. Data collected from the system corresponding to the superset is maintained online. A new significance signature of the system is periodically or intermittently determined by performing a discriminant analysis using the online superset data, and is used to detect an evolutionary change in the system.",

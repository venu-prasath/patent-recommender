    "title": "Method and system for mining quantitative association rules in large relational tables",
    "abstract": "A method and apparatus are disclosed for mining quantitative association rules from a relational table of records. The method comprises the steps of: partitioning the values of selected quantitative attributes into intervals, combining adjacent attribute values and intervals into ranges, generating candidate itemsets, determining frequent itemsets, and outputting an association rule when the support for a frequent itemset bears a predetermined relationship to the support for a subset of the frequent itemset. Preferably, the partitioning step includes determining whether to partition and the number of partitions based on a partial incompleteness measure. The candidate generation includes discarding those itemsets not meeting a user-specified interest level and those having a subset which is not a frequent itemset. The frequent itemsets are determined using super-candidates that include information of the candidate itemsets. Preferably, each super-candidate has a data structure, such as a multi-dimensional tree or array, representing quantitative attributes common to the replaced candidate itemsets.",

    "abstract": "A method may include applying, to a corpus of data, a first machine learning technique to identify candidate domains of an ontology mapping brain structure to mental function. The corpus of data may include textual data describing a plurality of mental functions and spatial data corresponding to a plurality of brain structures. A second machine technique may be applied to optimize a quantity of domains included in the ontology and/or a quantity of mental function terms included in each domain. The ontology may be applied to phenotype an electronic medical record and predict a clinical outcome for a patient associated with the electronic medical record. Related systems and articles of manufacture, including computer program products, are also provided.",

    "abstract": "An International Commodity Trade Exchange having a central exchange post for providing international commodity information and a plurality of local exchanges in at least two countries around the world. A plurality of user computer terminals are coupled to each of the local exchanges and can request and receive data representing marketing information directly from the central exchange host and transmit data representing bids and offers to any other user terminal around the world through the local exchanges and the host exchange. The communication takes place through a satellite communication network thereby allowing traders associated with any particular local exchange to trade in a selected market with any other trader associated with any other local exchange at any member site located in any country around the world.",

    "title": "Adaptive hypermedia presentation method and system",
    "abstract": "In a computer system comprising a hypermedia computing environment, the presentation of hypermedia objects is adapted to usage of the system. The frequency with which hypermedia objects are used is tracked and the objects are ordered such that the most frequently used hypermedia objects are made most accessible. The system also adapts to user characteristics such as user experience level, user disabilities and user preferences. For example, hypermedia objects inappropriate for beginner users are not displayed when a novice is using the system. Further, visual hypermedia objects are ordered ahead of audio hypermedia object for hearing impaired users.",

    "title": "Method and system for routing fibre channel frames",
    "abstract": "A method and system for transmitting frames using a fibre channel switch element is provided. The switch element includes a port having a receive segment and a transmit segment, wherein the fibre channel switch element determines if a port link has been reset; determines if a flush state has been enabled for the port; and removes frames from a buffer, if the flush state has been enabled for the port. For a flush state operation, frames are removed from a receive buffer of the fibre channel port as if it is a typical fibre channel frame transfer. The removed frames are sent to a processor for analysis. The method also includes, setting a control bit for activating frame removal from the transmit buffer; and diverting frames that are waiting in the transmit buffer and have not been able to move from the transmit buffer.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for transmitting frames using a fibre channel switch element, comprising:\ndetermining if a fibre channel switch element port link has been reset;\ndetermining if a flush state has been enabled for the port; and\nremoving frames from a receive buffer, if the flush state has been enabled for the port.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein if the flush state is not enabled, then the port operates as a typical fibre channel port.\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein fibre channel switch element firmware sets a control bit to enable flush state operation.\n4. The method of claim 1, for a flush state operation, frames are removed from a receive buffer of the fibre channel port as if it is a typical fibre channel frame transfer.\n5. The method of claim 1, wherein the removed frames are sent to a processor for analysis.\n6. A method for removing frames from a transmit buffer of a fibre channel switch element, comprising:\nsetting a control bit for activating frame removal from the transmit buffer; and\ndiverting frames that are waiting in the transmit buffer and have not been able to move from the transmit buffer.\n7. The method of claim 6, wherein if the diverted frames are of Class 2 or 3, the frames are tossed.\n8. The method of claim 6, wherein a Class 2 frame may be truncated before being diverted.\n9. The method of claim 6, wherein a processor analyzes the diverted frames.\n10. A fibre channel switch element, comprising:\na port having a receive segment and a transmit segment, wherein the fibre channel switch element determines if a port link has been reset; determines if a flush state has been enabled for the port; and removes frames from a buffer, if the flush state has been enabled for the port.\n11. The fibre channel switch element of claim 10, wherein if the flush state is not enabled, then the port operates as a typical fibre channel port.\n12. The fibre channel switch element of claim 10, wherein fibre channel switch element firmware sets a control bit to enable flush state operation.\n13. The fibre channel switch element of claim 10, for a flush state operation, frames are removed from a receive buffer of the fibre channel port as if it is a typical fibre channel frame transfer.\n14. The fibre channel switch element of claim 10, wherein the removed frames are sent to a processor for analysis.\n15. A fibre channel switch element for removing frames, comprising:\na port having a receive segment and a transmit segment with a receive and transmit buffer, wherein the fibre channel switch element firmware sets a control bit for activating frame removal from the transmit buffer; and diverts frames that are waiting in the transmit buffer and have not been able to move from the transmit buffer.\n16. The fibre channel switch element of claim 15, wherein if the diverted frames are of Class 2 or 3, the frames are tossed.\n17. The fibre channel switch element of claim 15, wherein a Class 2 frame may be truncated before being diverted.\n18. The fibre channel switch element of claim 15, wherein a processor analyzes the diverted frames.\n19. The method of claim 1, wherein frames are removed from a receive buffer without effecting all transmit ports.",

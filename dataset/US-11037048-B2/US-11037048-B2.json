    "abstract": "An automated conversation is facilitated between a user and a virtual agent. A system receives an input message from the user and analyzes an intent of the input message. Based on the intent of the input message, the system generates a plurality of bids for responding to the input message, and assigns an intent confidence score to each bid from the plurality of bids based on a confidence level of each bid from the plurality of bids. The system determines a winning bid from the plurality of bids based on the intent confidence score associated with each bid from the plurality of bids, and generates a response based on the winning bid.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method for facilitating an automated conversation between a user and a virtual agent in a system comprising a processor, a storage and a communication interface, the method comprising:\nreceiving, by the processor, an input message from the user;\nanalyzing, by the processor, an intent of the input message;\ngenerating, by the processor and based on the intent of the input message, a plurality of bids for responding to the input message;\nassigning, by the processor, an intent confidence score to each bid from the plurality of bids;\ndetermining, by the processor, a winning bid from the plurality of bids based on the intent confidence score associated with each bid from the plurality of bids;\ngenerating, by the processor, a response based on the winning bid; and\npresenting a non-winning bid to the user with an explanatory remark related to the non-winning bid, the non-winning bid being one of the plurality of bids other than the winning bid.\n2. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\ndetermining a resolution confidence score based at least on a measure of a capability of the system to resolve a user request associated with the input message; and\npresenting the response to the user based on the resolution confidence score.\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein the intent confidence score corresponds to a measure of an accuracy of the virtual agent's understanding of a user request based on the input message.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the winning bid is further based on a prior user conversation context and a quality of service associated with each bid from the plurality of bids.\n5. The method of claim 4, wherein the quality of service corresponds to a measure of user convenience associated with each bid from the plurality of bids.\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the winning bid is further based on at least one of: one or more heuristics and manual rules, and one or more trained machine learning modules.\n7. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the plurality of bids further comprises assigning a flag to each bid from the plurality of bids, wherein the flag assigned to each bid indicates a measure of a possibility of the bid resolving a user request associated with the input message, and wherein the flag comprises one of a high value flag, a low value flag and a negative value flag.\n8. The of claim 1, wherein the input message comprises at least one of: a text message, a voice message, and an audio-video message.\n9. A system for facilitating an automated conversation with a user, the system comprising:\nat least one processor;\na memory to store instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the system to:\nreceive an input message from the user;\nanalyze an intent of the input message;\ngenerate, based on the intent of the input message, a plurality of bids for responding to the input message;\nassign an intent confidence score to each bid from the plurality of bids;\ndetermine a winning bid from the plurality of bids based on the intent confidence score associated with each bid from the plurality of bids;\ngenerating a response based on the winning bid; and\npresent a non-winning bid to the user with an explanatory remark related to the non-winning bid, the non-winning bid being one of the plurality of bids other than the winning bid.\n10. The system of claim 9, wherein the system is further caused at least in part to:\ndetermine a resolution confidence score based at least on a measure of a capability of the system to resolve a user request associated with the input message; and\npresent the response to the user based on the resolution confidence score.\n11. The system of claim 9, wherein the intent confidence score corresponds to a measure of an accuracy of the virtual agent's understanding of a user request based on the input message.\n12. The system of claim 9, wherein the system is further caused at least in part to determine the winning bid based on a prior user conversation context, and a quality of service associated with each bid from the plurality of bids.\n13. The system of claim 12, wherein the quality of service corresponds to a measure of user convenience associated with each bid from the plurality of bids.\n14. The system of claim 9, wherein the system is further caused at least in part to determine the winning bid based on at least one of: one or more heuristics and manual rules, or one or more machine learning modules.\n15. The system of claim 9, wherein the system is further caused at least in part to assign a flag to each bid from the plurality of bids, wherein the flag assigned to each bid indicates a measure of a possibility of the bid resolving a user request associated with the input message, and wherein the flag comprises one of a high value flag, a low value flag and a negative value flag.\n16. The system of claim 9, wherein the input message comprises at least one of: a text message, a voice message, and an audio-video message.\n17. A method for facilitating an automated conversation between a user and a virtual agent in a system comprising a processor, a storage device and a communication interface, the method comprising:\nreceiving, by the processor, an input message from the user;\nanalyzing, by the processor, an intent of the input message;\ngenerating, by the processor and based on the intent of the input message, a plurality of bids for responding to the input message;\nassigning, by the processor, an intent confidence score to each bid from the plurality of bids;\nassigning, by the processor, a rank to each bid from the plurality of bids based on the intent confidence score associated with each bid from the plurality of bids;\nselecting, by the processor, top ranked ones of the plurality of bids based on the ranking of each bid from the plurality of bids; and\npresenting, by the processor, a plurality of responses corresponding to the selected top ranked bids.\n18. The method of claim 17, further comprising:\ndetermining a resolution confidence score based at least on a measure of a capability of the system to resolve a user request associated with the input message; and\npresenting the plurality of responses to the user based on the resolution confidence score.",

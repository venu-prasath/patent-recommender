A method of computerized aggregation for group purchasing involving at least three entities comprising:\nproviding a best buy indication to at least one of the at least three entities, based upon an analysis of benchmark information, for at least one semi-fungible product within a category, the at least one semi-fungible product having been offered by a first entity selected from among at least three entities;\nreceiving, from the at least one entity, an allocation of a portion of a total needs to at least one of the first entity or a second entity, the second entity also being selected from among the at least three entities; and\naggregating the allocation with a needs allocation, from at least one other entity.\n18. The method of claim 17 further comprising:\nincorporating the best buy indication into an entity viewable screen.\n19. The method of claim 17 further comprising:\ngraphically indicating an offering parameter relative to a utility function graph.\n20. The method of claim 17 further comprising:\nprompting for utility values for the at least one semi-fungible product.\n21. The method of claim 17 further comprising:\nprompting for pricing values for the at least one semi-fungible product.\n22. A negotiation method comprising:\nsubmitting a binding bid of a product at a specified price;\nreceiving an allocation of an award for the semi-fungible product;\nreceiving an identification of a calculated recommendation based upon information derived from an entity; and\nreducing the specified price by an amount in response to the recommendation.\n23. The negotiation method of claim 22 further comprising:\nreceiving an indication reflecting allocations to a competing provider.\n24. The negotiation method of claim 22 further comprising:\nreceiving an elapsed negotiation time indication.\n25. The negotiation method of claim 22 further comprising:\nreceiving a bid differential identifier.\n26. An on-line negotiation method comprising:\nengaging at least two purchasers and at least two providers in a negotiation session,\nreceiving, from a first of the at least two providers, a first bid of a first offering from a semi-fungible category at a first amount;\nreceiving, from a second of the at least two providers, a second bid of a second offering from the semi-fungible category at a second amount;\nidentifying a best value for a purchaser based upon a criterion specified by the purchaser and the first and second amounts;\nallowing at least one of the purchasers to individually specify, via an on-line interface, how they will allocate an award to at least one of the at least two providers; and\nallowing at least one of the purchasers to modify their allocation following an amount modification by either of the first or second providers.\n27.

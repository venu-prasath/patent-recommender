    "abstract": "Utilizing a computing device executing a master chatbot and one or more modular chatbots to respond to one or more chat messages. A computing device executing the master chatbot receives one or more chat messages. The computing device parses the received one or more chat messages to discover an intent and entities contained within the chat messages. A ranking algorithm is employed to rank the master chatbot and a plurality of modular chatbots, the ranking algorithm scoring the master chatbot and the plurality of modular chatbots based upon the intent and entities contained within the one or more chat messages. The master chatbot responds to the chat message if the ranking algorithm rates the master chatbot highest or forwards automatically the one or more chat messages to a ranked modular chatbot for response if the ranking algorithm rates the ranked modular chatbot highest.",

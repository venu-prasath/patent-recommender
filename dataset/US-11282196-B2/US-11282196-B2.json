    "abstract": "Mechanisms are provided for implementing a patient complexity classification (PCC) computing system. The PCC computing system receives medical image study data for a patient that comprises one or more medical image data structures and one or more corresponding medical image metadata data structures. A natural language processing engine of the PCC computing system performs natural language processing on the medical image metadata data structure to extract features indicative of at least one of patient or medical image characteristics. A complexity classifier of the PCC computing system evaluates the extracted features to determine a patient complexity indicating a complexity of a medical condition of the patient. Routing logic associated with the PCC computing system routes the one or more medical image data structures and one or more corresponding medical image metadata data structures to one or more downstream patient evaluation computing systems based on the determined patient complexity.",

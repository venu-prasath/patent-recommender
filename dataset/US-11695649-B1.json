    "abstract": "A system, method, and computer program product are provided for a determining a network situation in a communication network. In use, at least one threshold value of at least one operational parameter of a communication network is obtained, the at least one operational parameter representing at least one operational status of at least one of a computational device or a communication device. Additionally, log data of the communication network is obtained, the log data containing at least one value of the at least one operational parameter reported by at least one network entity of the communication network. The at least one value of the at least one operational parameter of the log data is compared with a corresponding threshold value of the at least one threshold value to form a detection of a network situation. Further, the detection of the network situation is reported if the at least one value of the at least one operational parameter of the log data traverses the corresponding threshold value of the at least one threshold value.",

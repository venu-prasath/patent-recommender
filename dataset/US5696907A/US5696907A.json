    "abstract": "The present invention discloses a method and system for performing risk and credit analysis of financial service applications with a neural network. The neural network imitates and perfects a credit manager's evaluation and decision process to control loss and guide business expansion. In particular, the neural network screens applications to control loss and to find directions where business volume can increase with a minimum increase in loss. Initially, data variables are pre-processed and applied to the neural network. The neural network in the present invention is optimized by a non-iterative regression process, as opposed to the computationally intensive back propagation algorithm.",

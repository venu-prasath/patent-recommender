    "abstract": "A medical scan report labeling system is operable to transmit a medical report that includes natural language text to a first client device for display. Identified medical condition term data is received from the first client device in response. An alias mapping pair in a medical label alias database is identified by determining that a medical condition term of the alias mapping pair compares favorably to the identified medical condition term data. A medical code that corresponds to the alias mapping pair and a medical scan that corresponds to the medical report are transmitted to a second client device of an expert user for display, and accuracy data is received from the second client device in response. The medical code is mapped to the first medical scan in the medical scan database when the accuracy data indicates that the medical code compares favorably to the medical scan.",

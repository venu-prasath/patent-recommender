    "abstract": "System, methods, and apparatuses for an artificial intelligence (AI) toy with improved conversational dialogue and personality development. The AI toy determines responses to stimuli based on user profiles and personality profiles that are developed through user interaction and external media inputs. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other semantic interaction processing is paired with the profiles to develop AI personality and conversational ability.",

The system of claim 5, wherein the handheld toy is operable to transmit the profile input to the VA service, and wherein the VA service is operable to construct or identify a corresponding user profile based on the profile input and construct the response based on the corresponding user profile.\n7. The system of claim 1, wherein the VA system is operable to process the stimulus and the media inputs with natural language processing (NLP).\n8. A method for using artificial intelligence (AI) for conversational interaction and artificial personality development comprising:\nproviding a handheld toy, wherein the handheld toy includes at least one processor, at least one memory with at least one database, at least one motion sensor, at least one camera, at least one speaker, and at least one microphone;\nproviding a virtual assistant (VA) service hosted on at least one server, wherein the VA service includes at least one VA processor and at least one VA memory with at least one VA database;\nwherein the at least one speaker and the at least one microphone are embedded in the handheld toy;\nwherein the handheld toy is in network communication with the VA service;\nthe handheld toy receiving a stimulus, recording the stimulus, and transmitting the stimulus to the VA service via a network;\nwherein the stimulus is a movement of the handheld toy, a sound, an image, or a video;\nthe VA service determining if the stimulus is a predefined movement, a speech input, a predefined face, or a gesture;\nthe VA service extracting user personality features from gestures, tones, keywords, or phrases of the stimulus and determining a user personality score based on the user personality features;\nthe VA service constructing at least one user profile and at least one personality profile and storing the at least one user profile and the at least one personality profile in the at least one VA database;\nwherein constructing the at least one user profile includes matching the stimulus to personal data, including the user personality score, personally identifiable information, settings, and preferences;\nwherein constructing the at least one personality profile includes:\nreceiving media inputs including a video, an audio clip, and/or text;\nextracting personality features from gestures, tones, keywords, or phrases of the media inputs; and\ndetermining a personality score based on the personality features of the media inputs;\nthe VA service constructing a response based on the personality score and the user personality score and transmitting the response to the handheld toy;\nwherein the response is a movement response, a sound response, an image response, or a video response; and\nthe handheld toy demonstrating the response.\n9.

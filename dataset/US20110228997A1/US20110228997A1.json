    "title": "Medical Image Rendering",
    "abstract": "Medical image rendering is described. In an embodiment a medical image visualization engine receives results from an organ recognition system which provide estimated organ centers, bounding boxes and organ classification labels for a given medical image. In examples the visualization engine uses the organ recognition system results to select appropriate transfer functions, bounding regions, clipping planes and camera locations in order to optimally view an organ. For example, a rendering engine uses the selections to render a two-dimensional image of medical diagnostic quality with minimal user input. In an embodiment a graphical user interface populates a list of organs detected in a medical image and a clinician is able to select one organ and immediately be presented with the optimal view of that organ. In an example opacity of background regions of the medical image may be adjusted to provide context for organs presented in a foreground region.",

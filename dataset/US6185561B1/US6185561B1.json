    "title": "Method and apparatus for providing and expression data mining database",
    "abstract": "According to the invention, a system and method for organizing expression information in a way that facilitates data mining. A database model is provided which may organize information relating to, e.g., sample preparation, expression analysis of experiment results, and intermediate and final results of mining expression and concentration results. The model is readily translatable into database languages such as SQL and the like. The database model scales to permit mining of expression or concentration information collected from large numbers of samples.",

    "title": "Engine control systems",
    "abstract": "An engine control system comprises a first transducer producing a first signal representative of a first engine parameter such as throttle angle, and a second transducer producing a second signal representative of another engine parameter such as engine speed. These signals are fed to a memory unit which produces an output dependent on the values of the first and second signals, and an output stage produces an output pulse which can be used to control an engine characteristic.",

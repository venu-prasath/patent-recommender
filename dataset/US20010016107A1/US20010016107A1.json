    "title": "Video signal reproducing apparatus",
    "abstract": "In a video signal reproducing apparatus, the changing time of a sub-video signal is adjusted, by a time-adjusting circuit, so as to be synchronized with the changing of a frame of a main video signal from the output of an interlace-scan-video-signal converter. And the sub-signal is added to the output of an interlace-scan converter by an adder. The output of the adder is converted into a progressive-scan video signal in synchronism with the boundary of frames of main video signal by the progressive-scan video signal converter. In the reproducing apparatus, even in the case that the sub-video signal is recorded without synchronism with the frames of the main video signal, an irregular frame is not generated even when the sub-video changes. And a single field of the sub-video does not leave or is not visible.",

    "claims": "\n1. A video signal reproducing apparatus for reproducing a video signal including a main video signal of progressive-scan video, and a sub-video signal changing asynchronously with the main video signal, comprising:\nan interlace-scan-video converter converting the main video signal into an interlace-scan video signal;\na sub-video adder for adding the sub-video signal to an output of said interlace-scan converter in synchronism with a boundary of frames of the main video signal in the output of said interlace-scan-video converter; and\na progressive-scan video converter converting the output of said sub-video adder into a progressive-scan video signal in synchronism with the boundary of frames of the main video signal.\n2. The video signal reproducing apparatus of\nclaim 1\n,\nwherein the main video signal is a signal composed of 24 frames per second, and\nwherein said interlace-scan converter issues the main video signal as an interlace-scan video signal of 2 fields and 3 fields per the frame.\n3. The video signal reproducing apparatus of\nclaim 1\n,\nwherein the main video signal is a progressive-scan video signal composed of 30 frames per second, and\nwherein said interlace-scan converter issues each frame of the main video signal as an interlace-scan video signal of 2 fields.\n4. The video signal reproducing apparatus of\nclaim 1\n,\n2\n, or 3, wherein the sub-video signal is subtitle information of the main video signal.\n5. The video signal reproducing apparatus of\nclaim 1\n,\n2\n, or 3, wherein the sub-video signal is information showing a state of an operation of the video signal reproducing apparatus.",

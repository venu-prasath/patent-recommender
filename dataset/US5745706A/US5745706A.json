    "title": "Computer system and related equipment for spending and investment account management",
    "abstract": "A method, computer system and equipment for managing an investment and spending account, so as to achieve selected guidelines for spending flexibility and investment returns. A computer system, for recording account information and a processor for processing account data and transactions associated with the account, implements a combined spending and investment account, by which an account holder achieves a selected degree of spending flexibility and a selected investment return. The computer system monitors inflows to and outflows from the account, and investment returns achieved for the account, and indicates when adjustments to the account are required to achieve the selected investment guidelines while presenting the account holder with the selected spending flexibility. The computer system associates a spending account with a related investment account, so that the account holder may access the spending account within the spending flexibility guidelines, while an account manager, either a human being or a computer program such as an artificial intelligence, controls the associated investment account within the investment guidelines. The computer system tracks and monitors the resources available in the spending account and the investment account, and responsive thereto, presents the account manager with signals indicating whether investment adjustments are suggested for meeting the investment guidelines and while still permitting outflows within the spending account according to the spending flexibility guidelines.",

    "title": "Business transaction and investment growth monitoring data processing system",
    "abstract": "A data processing system is disclosed which monitors client's business orders over time and based upon predetermined criteria determines the client's vested interest in funds deposited into special client accounts. The business order data is stored in uniquely formatted client account files. In addition, a vesting account file stores summary data encompassing all the client files. The data processing system updates and keeps track of client's vesting rights which are subject to change over time. The data processing system's ability to track these and many other conditions is enhanced by a unique set of control status words which control software flow and which are utilized to visually flag important statuses.",

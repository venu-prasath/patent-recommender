    "abstract": "Techniques for using noisy-robust discourse trees to determine a rhetorical relationship between sentences. In an example, a rhetoric classification application creates a noisy-robust communicative discourse tree. The application accesses accesses a first communicative discourse tree derived from a first sentence, a third sentence, and a fourth sentence and a second communicative discourse tree derived from a second sentence, the third sentence, and the fourth sentence. The application determines that syntactic parse trees cannot be generated for the first sentence and the second sentence. The application identifies a common rhetorical relationship between the first communicative discourse tree and the second communicative discourse tree. The application removes an elementary discourse unit that does not correspond to the common rhetorical relationship from the first communicative discourse tree and the second communicative discourse tree. The application merges the first and second communicative discourse trees, thereby creating a noisy-text robust communicative discourse tree.",

The method of claim 4, wherein the verb is a communicative verb and each verb signature of the plurality of verb signatures comprises one of (i) an adverb, (ii) a noun phrase, or (iii) a noun.\n6. The method of claim 4, wherein the associating further comprises:\nidentifying each of the plurality of thematic roles in the particular verb signature; and\nmatching, for each of the plurality of thematic roles in the particular verb signature, a corresponding word to the respective thematic role.\n7. The method of claim 1, wherein the first sentence or the second sentence comprises a word that is incorrectly spelled or a grammatical error.\n8. A non-transitory computer-readable medium comprising computer-executable program instructions, wherein when executed by a processing device, the computer-executable program instructions configures the processing device to perform operations comprising:\naccessing a first communicative discourse tree from a first, third, and fourth sentences;\naccessing a second communicative discourse tree from a second sentence, the third sentence, and the fourth sentences;\ndetermining that syntactic parse trees cannot be generated for the first sentence and the second sentence;\nidentifying, between the first communicative discourse tree and the second communicative discourse tree, a common rhetorical relationship;\nremoving, from the first communicative discourse tree and the second communicative discourse tree, an elementary discourse unit that does not correspond to the common rhetorical relationship; and\nmerging the first and second communicative discourse trees, thereby creating a noisy-text robust communicative discourse tree.\n9. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein merging the first and second communicative discourse trees comprises identifying, between the first communicative discourse tree and the second communicative discourse tree, (i) a mapping of elementary discourse units or (ii) a common rhetorical relationship.\n10. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein determining that a syntactic parse tree cannot be generated for a particular sentence comprises:\naccessing a first confidence score for the respective sentence, wherein the first confidence score represents a confidence of a first parse;\naccessing a second confidence score for the respective sentence, wherein the second confidence score represents a confidence of a second parse; and\ndetermining that a difference between the first confidence score and the second score confidence is above a threshold.\n11. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein each sentence comprises a plurality of fragments and a verb, and wherein generating a communicative discourse tree comprises:\ngenerating a discourse tree that represents rhetorical relationships between the plurality of fragments, wherein the discourse tree comprises a plurality of nodes, each nonterminal node representing a rhetorical relationship between two of the plurality of fragments, each terminal node of the nodes of the discourse tree is associated with one of the plurality of fragments; and\nmatching each fragment that has a verb to a verb signature, thereby creating a communicative discourse tree, the matching comprising:\naccessing a plurality of verb signatures, wherein each verb signature comprises the verb of the fragment and a sequence of thematic roles, wherein thematic roles describe a relationship between the verb and related words;\ndetermining, for each verb signature of the plurality of verb signatures, a plurality of thematic roles of the respective signature that match a role of a word in the fragment;\nselecting a particular verb signature from the plurality of verb signatures based on the particular verb signature comprising a highest number of matches; and\nassociating the particular verb signature with the fragment.\n12. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 11, wherein the associating further comprises:\nidentifying, for each verb signature, each of the plurality of thematic roles; and\nmatching, for each of the plurality of thematic roles in the particular verb signature, a corresponding word to the respective thematic role.\n13.

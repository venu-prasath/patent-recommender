    "abstract": "Techniques for using noisy-robust discourse trees to determine a rhetorical relationship between sentences. In an example, a rhetoric classification application creates a noisy-robust communicative discourse tree. The application accesses accesses a first communicative discourse tree derived from a first sentence, a third sentence, and a fourth sentence and a second communicative discourse tree derived from a second sentence, the third sentence, and the fourth sentence. The application determines that syntactic parse trees cannot be generated for the first sentence and the second sentence. The application identifies a common rhetorical relationship between the first communicative discourse tree and the second communicative discourse tree. The application removes an elementary discourse unit that does not correspond to the common rhetorical relationship from the first communicative discourse tree and the second communicative discourse tree. The application merges the first and second communicative discourse trees, thereby creating a noisy-text robust communicative discourse tree.",

    "abstract": "A method for dynamically updating a model is described. The method includes accessing a model that specifies expected characteristics for a transaction. The model includes variables associated with fraud. The method also includes receiving at least one value for each of the variables while monitoring transactions, and updating a distribution of values for each variable based on the received value. The received value is compared with the updated distribution to determine a deviation from a threshold value associated with a percentile of the updated distribution that is indicative of fraud.",

The method of claim 1, wherein the distribution of values for each variable represent historical values for previous transactions of the type.\n3. The method of claim 1, further comprising weighting each determined deviation with a coefficient correlated to an assigned importance of each variable within the model.\n4. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining a score indicative of a probability of fraud for a transaction of the type based on, for each of the variables, the deviation of the received value from the threshold.\n5. The method of claim 1, further comprising scaling, for each of the variables, the determined deviation based on a variance range between the threshold value and a maximum expected value of the updated distribution.\n6. The method of claim 5, further comprising determining a score indicative of a probability of fraud for the transaction based on the scaled determined deviations.\n7. The method of claim 6, further comprising weighting each of the scaled determined deviations with a coefficient correlated to an assigned importance of each of the variables within the model.\n8. The method of claim 7, wherein each of the scaled determined deviations is calculated based on an equation comprising:\n9. The method of claim 8, wherein the score is calculated based on an equation comprising:\n\n\u03b7=\u03a3q(x i|\u03b8)\nwhere \u03b7 is the score.\n10. The method of claim 1, further comprising scaling, for each of the variables, the determined deviation based on a variance range assigned or selected by a user.\n11. The method of claim 1, further comprising scaling, for each of the variables, the determined deviation based on a variance range between the percentile of values of the updated distribution that are indicative of fraud and a percentile of one or more values of the updated distribution that is indicative of a maximum significant value.\n12. The method of claim 1, wherein:\nthe model comprises segments; and\nat least one of the segments is generated based on user input.\n13. The method of claim 1, wherein:\nthe model comprises segments; and\nat least one segment's expected characteristics for the type of transaction differ from expected characteristics of other segments of the model.\n14. The method of claim 13, further comprising identifying the received values as associated with the at least one segment and exclusively updating, relative to the other segments, the distribution of values for at least one variable of the at least one segment based on the received values.\n15. The method of claim 14, further comprising determining a score indicative of a probability of fraud for a transaction of the type based on the updated at least one segment.\n16.

The method of claim 26, wherein the variables are further determined by scaling, for each variable, the received value using the updated threshold value.\n28. The method of claim 26, wherein each of the distributions of values represents values for multiple transactions initiated by various different users.\n29.

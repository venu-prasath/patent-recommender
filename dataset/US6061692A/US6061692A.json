    "title": "System and method for administering a meta database as an integral component of an information server",
    "abstract": "An information server adapted to service requests for information has an integral database containing configuration information, application information, and/or content information. The information in the database is stored in a hierarchical fashion with elements that correspond, in some degree, with physical storage structure or individual information objects on the information server. Path names received in information requests are broken into constituent components and are used to retrieve configuration information, application information, and/or content information from the database and information objects from physical storage. In the database properties stored at one hierarchical level may be inherited by lower hierarchical levels. The database is preferably provided with a programmatic interface that allows concurrent access to and administration of the database. Mechanisms to notify registered users of changes or events that occur with respect to the database are implemented.",

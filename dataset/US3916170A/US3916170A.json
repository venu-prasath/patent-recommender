    "title": "Air-fuel ratio feed back type fuel injection control system",
    "abstract": "A fuel injection control system comprising an air-fuel ratio feedback control in combination with an electronically controlled fuel injection system. In this system, the concentration of oxygen contained in the engine exhaust gases is compared with a predetermined value in a comparator whereby whether the fuel injection quantity is to be corrected in a direction to increase it or in a direction to decrease it is determined in accordance with the output of the comparator, and the rate of change of the correction is controlled in accordance with a sum output produced by adding a detected value of engine rpms and a detected value of engine intake state. When the air-fuel control cannot operate properly, for example because of a low exhaust temperature or under deceleration conditions, a holding circuit is connected to the integrater output to maintain the integrated output at a value intermediate the fluctuating range thereof. The system has an excellent follow-up characteristic to respond to rapid changes in the operating conditions of an engine and it is capable of maintaining the air-fuel mixture ratio at a predetermined value.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method of extending an initially fractured subterranean formation penetrated by a well bore with a stable foam, said foam comprising a mixed dispersion of a liquid base, a surfactant, a propping agent and a gas such that the Mitchell quality of said foam at the temperature and fracture extension pressure of the formation, as derived from the formula: ##EQU3## where \u0393 tp = the Mitchell derived quality\nVsg = the volume of saturated gas (excluding gas in solution if any)\nVf = the volume of foam\nis between the range of 0.5236 to 0.9999;\ninjecting said foam into said well bore and increasing the pressure of said foam against said formation to reopen and/or extend said initial fracture of said formation.\n2. A method in accord with claim 1 wherein said liquid base is oil.\n3. A method in accord with claim 1 wherein said liquid base is water.\n4. A method in accord with claim 1 wherein said liquid base is an acid.\n5. A method in accord with claim 1 wherein said gas is from the group consisting of air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, normally gaseous and normally liquid hydrocarbon gases.\n6. A method of claim 1 wherein said foam includes a formation treating agent and is still within said Mitchell quality.\n7. A method of claim 6 wherein said formation treating composition is a clay swelling inhibitor.\n8. A method of claim 6 wherein said composition is an acid capable of reacting with said formation.\n9. A stable foam composition for fracturing subterranean hydrocarbon bearing formation comprising, a mixed dispersion of a liquid base, a surfactant, a propping agent and a gas such that the Mitchell quality of said foam at the temperatures and break-down pressures of the formation as derived from the formula: ##EQU4## where \u0393 tp = the Mitchell derived quality\nVsg = the volume of saturated gas (excluding gas in solution if any)\nVf = the volume of foam\nis between the range of 0.5236 to 0.9999.\n10. The composition of claim 9 wherein said liquid base is oil.\n11. The composition of claim 9 wherein said liquid base is water.\n12. The composition of claim 9 wherein said gas is from the group consisting of air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, normally gaseous and normally liquid hydrocarbon gases.\n13. A method of initially fracturing a subterranean formation penetrated by a well bore within a stable foam, said foam comprising a mixed dispersion of a liquid base, a surfactant, a propping agent and a gas such that the Mitchell quality of said foam at the temperature and pressures of the formation at the time of treatment as derived from the formula: ##EQU5## where \u0393 tp = the Mitchell derived quality\nVsg = the volume of saturated gas (excluding gas in solution if any)\nVf = the volume of foam\nis between the range of 0.5236 to 0.9999;\ninjecting said foam into said well bore and increasing the pressure of said foam against said formation until break-down and fracture of said formation.\n14. A method in accord with claim 13 wherein said liquid base is oil.\n15. A method in accord with claim 13 wherein said liquid base is water.\n16. A method in accord with claim 13 wherein said liquid base is an acid.\n17. A method in accord with claim 13 wherein said gas is from the group consisting of air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, normally gaseous and normally liquid hydrocarbon gases.\n18. A method of claim 13 wherein said foam includes a formation treating agent and is still within said Mitchell quality.\n19. A method of claim 18 wherein said formation treating composition is a clay swelling inhibitor.\n20. A method of claim 18 wherein said composition is an acid capable of reacting with said formation.",

    "abstract": "Examples of artificial intelligence-based reasoning explanation are described. In an example implementation, a knowledge model having a plurality of ontologies and a plurality of inferencing rules is generated. Once the knowledge model is generated, based on a real-world problem, a knowledge model from amongst various knowledge models is selected to be used for resolving a real-world problem. The data procured from the real-world problem is clustered and classified into an ontology of the determined knowledge model. Inferencing rules to be used for deconstructing the real-world problem are identified, and a machine reasoning is generated to provide a hypothesis for the problem and an explanation to accompany the hypothesis.",

    "title": "Edge server java application framework having application server instance resource monitoring and management",
    "abstract": "An application deployment model for enterprise applications enables such applications to be deployed to and executed from a globally distributed computing platform, such as an edge server in an Internet content delivery network (CDN). In a representative embodiment, a CDN edge server supports application server code that executes a Web tier and/or Enterprise tier component of a given Java-based application. When multiple instances of the application server code are executed, given resources (e.g., memory, CPU, disk and network I/O) are monitored, and the application server instances are terminated or rate-limited to prevent over-utilization by any particular instance. In addition, a given application running in a given application server instance is restricted from taking certain actions, e.g., reading or writing from a file system, so that it cannot interfere with or access data from another customer's application.",

    "claims": "\n1. In an apparatus for use in a distributed computing platform and having a processor, an edge server manager, a virtual machine, and an application server, the improvement comprising:\ncode that interfaces the edge server manager to a set of one or more application server instances, each of which are selectively instantiated on a virtual machine instance to execute a given application component;\ncode that monitors given resource utilization by each of the application server instances and that, responsive to such monitoring, invokes a given action with respect to any application server instance that over-utilizes a given resource; and\ncode for preventing a given application component executing in a given application server instance from taking a given action.\n2. In the apparatus as described in claim 1 wherein the given action invoked is the termination of the application server instance that over-utilizes the given resource.\n3. In the apparatus as described in claim 2 wherein the given action invoked is a rate limiting of the application server instance that over-utilizes the given resource.\n4. In the apparatus as described in claim 1 wherein the given resource is a resource selected from a set of resources that includes memory usage, CPU usage, disk usage and network I/O usage.\n5. In the apparatus as described in claim 1 wherein the given action prevented by the given application component is selected from a set of actions that includes: restricting the given application component's reading or writing to a file system, restricting the given application component's ability to open sockets, restricting the given application component's ability to start, stop or modify threads, and restricting the given application's ability to read given server code.\n6. A method operative in an apparatus having a processor, a virtual machine, and an application server, and a set of application components, comprising:\nin response to requests, initiating a set application server instances;\nexecuting the application components on the application server instances to respond to the requests;\nduring execution of the application components, monitoring utilization of given resources by each of the application server instances; and\nresponsive to the monitoring, invoking a given action with respect to any application server instance that over-utilizes a given resource.\n7. The method as described in claim 6 further including the step of restricting a given application component executing in a given application server instance from taking a given action.\n8. The method as described in claim 7 wherein the given action prevented by the given application component is selected from a set of actions that includes: restricting the given application component's reading or writing to a file system, restricting the given application component's ability to open sockets, restricting the given application component's ability to start, stop or modify threads, and restricting the given application's ability to read given server code.\n9. The method as described in claim 6 wherein the given action invoked is the termination of the application server instance that over-utilizes the given resource.\n10. In the apparatus as described in claim 6 wherein the given action invoked is a rate limiting of the application server instance that over-utilizes the given resource.\n11. The method as described in claim 6 wherein the given resource is a resource selected from a set of resources that includes memory usage, CPU usage, disk usage and network I/O usage.\n12. A method operative in an apparatus having a processor, a virtual machine, and an application server, and a set of application components, comprising:\nin response to requests, initiating a set application server instances;\nexecuting the application components on the application server instances to respond to the requests;\nduring execution of the application components, restricting a given application component executing in a given application server instance from taking a given action.\n13.

The method as described in claim 13 wherein the given action invoked is the termination of the application server instance that over-utilizes the given resource.\n15. In the apparatus as described in claim 13 wherein the given action invoked is a rate limiting of the application server instance that over-utilizes the given resource.\n16. The method as described in claim 13 wherein the given resource is a resource selected from a set of resources that includes memory usage, CPU usage, disk usage and network I/O usage.\n17. The method as described in claim 12 wherein the given action prevented by the given application component is selected from a set of actions that includes: restricting the given application component's reading or writing to a file system, restricting the given application component's ability to open sockets, restricting the given application component's ability to start, stop or modify threads, and restricting the given application's ability to read given server code.\n18. The method as described in claim 12 wherein each application server instance executes in association with a virtual machine instance.",

    "claims": "\n1. A system comprising:\na processor;\na graphical user interface coupled to the processor, the graphical user interface comprising an input device and a display screen; and\nmemory coupled to the processor and storing instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the system to perform operations comprising:\nretrieving a first avatar from a server wherein retrieving the first avatar comprises receiving a first avatar dataset comprising a first plurality of avatar components associated with a first user;\ngenerating a modified first avatar based on the first avatar and an avatar definition and requirement of a service environment associated with the system, wherein generating the modified first avatar comprises:\ndetermining the avatar definition and requirement of the service environment;\nidentifying a subset of the first plurality of avatar components associated with the avatar definition and requirement of the service environment;\nmodifying the subset of the first plurality of avatar components to generate one or more modified first avatar components, and\ngenerating a modified first avatar based on the one or more modified first avatar components; and\ndisplaying the modified first avatar on the display screen of the graphical user interface.\n2. The system of claim 1, the system to perform operations further comprising:\ndisplaying a plurality of avatar components on the display screen of the graphical user interface;\nreceiving via the input device of the graphical user interface a selection of the first plurality of avatar components from the plurality of displayed avatar components.\n3. The system of claim 1, wherein one or more of the first plurality of avatar components includes one or more of: a category name, a category type, a gender, a subcategory name, and a state.\n4. The system of claim 1, wherein receiving the first avatar dataset includes:\nretrieving, from a computing device in communication with the system over a network, the first avatar dataset.\n5. The system of claim 4, wherein retrieving the first avatar dataset from the computing device includes retrieving avatar components each having a common characteristic, the common characteristic including one or more of: an identical category name, an identical category type, an identical gender, an identical subcategory name, and an identical state.\n6. The system of claim 1, the system to perform operations further comprising:\ndetermining that the first user participated in an activity; and\nmodifying the one or more of the first plurality of avatar components in response to determining the first user participated in the activity, wherein the modified first avatar displayed on the display screen is based on the activity.\n7. The system of claim 6, wherein modifying the one or more of the first plurality of avatar components includes: including an icon to the first avatar, including a title with the first avatar, or changing an appearance of the first avatar.\n8. The system of claim 1, wherein modifying one or more of the first plurality of avatar components includes:\nextracting information regarding the first user from a social networking platform, wherein the information regarding the first user from the social networking platform includes: interests of the user, physiological data of the user, or emotional data of the user; and\nmodifying one or more of the first plurality of avatar components based on the extracted information regarding the first user.\n9. The system of claim 1, wherein displaying the modified first avatar comprises displaying the modified first avatar on a social networking platform in communication with the system or within a messaging application.\n10. The system of claim 1, wherein displaying the modified first avatar comprises displaying the modified first avatar within: a custom comic, a custom animation, a group of personalized emoticons, or an e-greeting card.\n11. A computer-implemented method comprising:\nretrieving, by a processor, a first avatar from a server, wherein retrieving the first avatar comprises receiving a first avatar dataset comprising a first plurality of avatar components associated with a first user;\ngenerating a modified first avatar based on the first avatar and an avatar definition and requirement of a service environment associated with the processor, wherein generating the modified first avatar comprises:\ndetermining the avatar definition and requirement of the service environment;\nidentifying a subset of the first plurality of avatar components associated with the avatar definition and requirement of the service environment;\nmodifying the subset of the first plurality of avatar components to generate one or more modified first avatar components, and\ngenerating a modified first avatar based on the one or more modified first avatar components; and\ndisplaying the modified first avatar on a display screen .\n12. The computer-implemented method of claim 11, wherein further comprising:\ndisplaying a plurality of avatar components on the display screen; and\nreceiving via an input device a selection of the first plurality of avatar components from the plurality of displayed avatar components.\n13. The computer-implemented method of claim 11, wherein receiving the first avatar dataset includes:\nretrieving, from a computing device in communication with the processor over a network, the first avatar dataset.\n14. The computer-implemented method of claim 11, wherein further comprising:\ndetermining that the first user participated in an activity; and\nmodifying the one or more of the first plurality of avatar components in response to determining the first user participated in the activity, wherein the modified first avatar displayed on the display screen is based on the activity.\n15. The computer-implemented method of claim 14, wherein modifying the first avatar includes: displaying an icon with the first avatar, displaying a title with the first avatar, or changing an appearance of the first avatar.\n16. The computer-implemented method of claim 11, wherein modifying one or more of the first plurality of avatar components includes:\nextracting information regarding the first user from a social networking platform, wherein the information regarding the first user from the social networking platform includes:\ninterests of the user, physiological data of the user, or emotional data of the user; and\nmodifying one or more of the first plurality of avatar components based on the extracted information regarding the first user.\n17. The computer-implemented method of claim 11, wherein displaying the modified first avatar comprises displaying the modified first avatar on a social networking platform in communication with the processor or within a messaging application.\n18. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by a computer system, cause the computer system to perform operations comprising:\nretrieving a first avatar from a server, wherein retrieving the first avatar comprises receiving a first avatar dataset comprising a first plurality of avatar components associated with a first user;\ngenerating a modified first avatar based on the first avatar and an avatar definition and requirement of a service environment associated with the computer system, wherein generating the modified first avatar comprises:\ndetermining the avatar definition and requirement of the service environment;\nidentifying a subset of the first plurality of avatar components associated with the avatar definition and requirement of the service environment;\nmodifying the subset of the first plurality of avatar components to generate one or more modified first avatar components, and\ngenerating a modified first avatar based on the one or more modified first avatar components; and\ndisplaying the modified first avatar on a display screen.\n19. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 18, wherein modifying one or more of the first plurality of avatar components includes:\nextracting information regarding the first user from a social networking platform, wherein the information regarding the first user from the social networking platform includes: interests of the user, physiological data of the user, or emotional data of the user; and\nmodifying one or more of the first plurality of avatar components based on the extracted information regarding the first user.\n20. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 18, wherein displaying the modified first avatar comprises displaying the modified first avatar on a social networking platform in communication with the computer system or within a messaging application."

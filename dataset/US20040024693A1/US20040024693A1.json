    "title": "Proprietary risk management clearinghouse",
    "abstract": "A computerized risk management method and system for facilitating analysis and quantification of risk associated with a risk subject on a proprietary basis. A proprietary risk management system combines gathered information with information received from a source such as an automated risk management clearinghouse system and maintains a database to relate risk variables and calculate a measurement of risk. The measurement, which can be a risk quotient or other rating based upon a weighted algorithm applied to the risk variables, is indicative of risk associated with the risk subject. Actions commensurate with a risk quotient can be presented to a user to facilitate management of risk associated with a particular entity or transaction or other transaction. A stored history can be created to mitigate adverse effects relating to a problematic transaction.",

    "claims": "\n1. A computer implemented method for managing regulatory and reputational risk, the method comprising the steps of:\nreceiving into a computer system data descriptive of informational artifacts with content related to at least one of: reputational risk, regulatory risk and legal risk;\ndefining within the computer system one or more risk variables generally related to one or more financial transactions;\nreceiving into the computer system proprietary data descriptive of a particular financial transaction;\nidentifying one or more risk variables with the received data descriptive of the particular financial transaction;\nassociating at least one informational artifact with content related to at least one of:\nreputational risk, regulatory risk and legal risk, with the risk variables identified; and\ngenerating a report for use within a predefined organization and comprising a description of the informational artifacts associated with the risk variables identified.\n2. The method of claim 1 additionally comprising the step of:\ngenerating in the computer system a risk quotient indicative of a quantitative amount of at least one of: reputational risk, regulatory risk and legal risk, associated with the financial transaction, wherein the risk quotient is based upon the at least one informational artifact associated with the risk variables.\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein the data descriptive of informational artifacts with content related to at least one of: reputational risk, regulatory risk and legal risk is received from a risk management clearinghouse data provider.\n4. The method of claim 1 additionally comprising the step of generating a suggested action based upon to informational artifacts associated with the risk variables identified.\n5. The method of claim 4 wherein the suggested action is directed towards reducing risk related to a financial transaction with international exposure.\n6.

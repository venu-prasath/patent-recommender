    "title": "Method for predictive prefetching of information over a communications network",
    "abstract": "A method for predictive prefetching of objects over a computer network including the steps of providing a client computer system, providing a server computer system, the server computer system having a memory, a network link to the client computer system, the network link also providing connection of the server computer system to the computer network, requesting from the server computer system by the client computer system a retrieval of a plurality of objects, retrieving the plurality of objects by the server system, storing the retrieval and an identity of the client computer system in the memory of the server computer system, sending the plurality of objects from the server computer system to the client computer system over the network link, predicting in the server computer system a plurality of subsequent retrieval requests from the client computer system according to a predetermined criteria, sending the prediction to the client computer system, and prefetching by the client computer system an object based on the prediction and other information. With such an arrangement, an object may be prefetched before a user actually requests it. This makes the retrieval latency appear to be zero when a user requests a prefetched object.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for predictive prefetching of objects over a computer network comprising the steps of:\nproviding client computer systems;\nproviding a server computer system, the server computer system having network links to the client computer systems;\nrequesting from the server computer system by one of the client computer systems retrieval of an object;\nsending the requested object from the server computer system to the requesting client computer system over its network link;\ngenerating in the server computer system a list of predicted subsequent retrieval requests from the requesting client computer system based on previous requests by all the client computer systems recorded in the server computer system;\nsending the list to the requesting client computer system; and\nprefetching by the client computer system an object from the list based on other information.\n2. The method for predictive prefetching of objects over a computer network according to claim 1 wherein the other information is whether the object is already in a cache of the client computer system.\n3. The method for predictive prefetching of objects over a computer network according to claim 1 wherein the other information is whether a user on the client computer system has been idle for more than a threshold interval.\n4. The method for predictive prefetching of objects over a computer network according to claim 1 wherein the other information is a size of the object.\n5. The method for predictive prefetching of objects over a computer network according to claim 1 wherein the step of prefetching by the client computer system an object based on the prediction further includes the steps of:\ndetermining whether the client system has made a request for a specific object;\nsignalling the server system to suspend processing and transmission of the prefetch step to the client system;\nfetching the specific object by the server computer system;\nsending the specific object to the client computer system; and\nsignalling the server system that processing and transmission of the prefetch step to the client computer system may resume.\n6. A method for predictive prefetching of objects over a computer network comprising the steps of:\nproviding client computer systems;\nproviding a server computer system, the server computer system having network links to the client computer systems;\nrequesting from the server computer system by one of the client computer systems retrieval of an object;\nsending the requested object from the server computer system to the requesting client computer system over its network link;\ngenerating in the server computer system a list of predicted subsequent retrieval requests from the requesting client computer system based on previous requests by all the client computer systems recorded in the server computer system; and\nsending the list to the requesting client computer system.\n7. A method for predictive prefetching of objects over a computer network for client computer systems connected by a network link to a server computer system comprising the steps of:\ngenerating in the server computer system a list of predicted subsequent retrieval requests for objects from a request for an object sent by a client computer system the list being based on previous requests for the same object by all the client computer systems recorded in the server computer; and\nsending the list to the requesting client computer system.",

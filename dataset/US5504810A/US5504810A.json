    "title": "Telecommunications fraud detection scheme",
    "abstract": "Methods and apparatus are disclosed for providing increased security in a telecommunications network by using quasi-time domain reflectometry techniques to identify those telephone calls which comprise multiple legs. Echo data are collected for the telephone call from a predetermined point in the network to a point where the call originated. The data are processed to generate an indication of whether the telephone call comprises multiple legs, thus identifying those calls most susceptible to unauthorized use. The indication that a telephone call comprises multiple legs is advantageously used together with call attribute information, such as whether the call is placed to an international destination, to determine whether a given multiple-leg call is most likely a valid access to the communication system or most likely fraudulent.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method comprising the steps of:\nanalyzing echo characteristics of a path of a telephone call to determine whether the telephone call is a multiple-leg call;\ncollecting data representing attributes of the telephone call when the echo characteristics indicate that the telephone call is a multiple-leg call; and\nprocessing the data to generate an indication of whether the telephone call was established fraudulently.\n2. The method of claim 1 wherein the processing step comprises determining whether the condition of at least one call attribute indicates that the telephone call was established fraudulently.\n3. The method of claim 1 wherein the analyzing step comprises the steps of:\ngenerating echo data for the telephone call from a predetermined point in the network to a point where the call originated; and\nresponding to the echo data to generate an indication of whether the telephone call comprises multiple legs.\n4. The method of claim 3 wherein the responding step comprises:\nfiltering the echo data to identify echo peaks; and\ngenerating an indication that the telephone call is a multiple-leg call if there are at least two identified echo peaks.\n5. The method of claim 3 wherein the responding step comprises:\ndetermining from the echo data the echo return loss between the predetermined point and the point where the call originated; and\ncomparing the determined echo return loss with an expected echo return loss for the telephone call; and\ngenerating an indication that the telephone call is a multiple-leg call if the determined echo return loss exceeds the expected echo return loss by more than a predetermined amount.\n6. The method of claim 3 wherein the responding step comprises:\ndetermining from the echo data the approximate distance between the predetermined point and the point where the call originated; and\ncomparing the determined distance with an expected distance for the telephone call; and\ngenerating an indication that the telephone call is a multiple-leg call if the determined distance exceeds the expected distance by more than a predetermined amount.\n7. The method of claim 1 wherein the step of processing call attribute data comprises determining whether the call is placed to a country which belongs to a predetermined group of high-fraud countries.\n8. A method comprising the steps of:\ndetecting the echo characteristics of the path of a telephone call;\ncollecting data representing attributes of the telephone call;\ndetermining whether the collected data and the echo characteristics of the path are consistent with each other; and\ngenerating an indication that the telephone call was established fraudulently when the collected data and the characteristics of the path are inconsistent with each other.\n9. The method of claim 8 wherein the detecting step comprises determining the approximate distance between a predetermined point in the path and a point where the call originated.\n10. The method of claim 9 wherein the determining step comprises comparing said distance with a country code which identifies a country from which the telephone call originated.",

    "abstract": "Big data analysis methods and machine learning based models are used to provide offer recommendations to consumers that are probabilistically determined to be relevant to a given consumer. Machine learning based matching of user attributes and offer attributes is first performed to identify potentially relevant offers for a given consumer. A de-duplication process is then used to identify and eliminate any offers represented in the offer data that the consumer has already seen, has historically shown no interest in, has already accepted, that are directed to product or service types the user/consumer already owns, for which the user does not qualify, or that are otherwise deemed to be irrelevant to the consumer.",
    "claims": "\n1.

The method of claim 1, further comprising:\ntraining a financial attribute extraction model with the transaction model training data and the credit history model training data using a machine learning process to identify one or more financial attributes of the user; and\nextracting the financial attributes of the user from the raw user data by executing the trained financial attribute extraction model based on one or both of the user's transaction data and the user's credit history data.\n6. The method of claim 5, wherein the financial attributes include one or more of spending characteristics, merchants used, types of purchases, products and services recently or historically purchased, financial situation, financial characteristics, historical transaction amounts, payees, transaction locations, transaction recurrence or frequency of transactions, withdrawals, mortgage/rent payments, credit card payments, charitable contributions, alimony or child support payments, income, insurance payments, credit card account data, loan/mortgage, credit scores, debt to income ratio data, or bank account balances.\n7. The method of claim 1, wherein:\nthe user attributes include one or more of an age group, an income group, general user demographics, health, education, employment, a residence area, financial preferences, financial behavior, spending behavior, saving behavior, or risk tolerance; and\nthe offer attributes include one or more of the names of providers associated with the offers, categories of the providers associated with the offers, terms of the offers, rewards or loyalty programs associated with the offers, or approval criteria or acceptance rates associated with the offers.\n8. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\ntraining a historical offer extraction model with the transaction model training data and the credit history model training data using a machine learning process to identify historical offers of the user; and\ndetermining the historical offers by executing the trained historical offer extraction model based on one or both of the user's transaction data and the user's credit history data.\n9. The method of claim 8, wherein the credit history data includes one or more of current and historical credit scores, debt to income ratio data, account balances, credit balances, credit card account data, loan/mortgage data, savings account balance data, checking account balance data, overdraft account balance data, and personal information data.\n10. The method of claim 8, wherein the transaction data includes one or more of historical transaction amounts, historical transaction payees, items purchased, purchase locations, recurrence of transactions, frequency of transactions, withdrawals, mortgage/rent payments, credit card payments, charitable contributions, alimony or child support payments, expense transactions, income transactions, or insurance payments.\n11. A financial management computing system configured to recommend relevant and non-duplicative offers to a user, comprising:\none or more processors;\na memory storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, causes the system to:\nreceive offer data including current offers and historical offers made by the user for products or services associated with the financial management computing system;\nreceive raw user data for a plurality of users of the financial management computing system, the raw user data including one or more of profile data, behavior data, preference data, transaction data, or credit history data for each of the plurality of users;\ntransform the raw user data into model training data that includes one or more of profile training data, behavior training data, preference training data, transaction training data, and credit history training data;\ntrain a user/offer attribute matching model with the model training data using a machine learning process to identify attribute matching data indicative of correlations between pairs of user attributes and offer attributes;\ntrain an offer recommendation model with one or both of the model training data and the attribute matching data using a machine learning process to identify potential offers to be recommended to one or more users of the plurality of users;\ndetermine the attribute matching information by executing the trained user/offer attribute matching model, the determined attribute matching information indicating whether pairs of user attributes and offer attributes match one another;\ngenerate de-duplicated offer data by removing, from the offer data, offers that the user has already seen, offers that the user has already accepted, offers that the user has historically shown no interest in, or offers for which the user does not qualify;\ngenerate one or more recommended offers for the user by executing the trained offer recommendation model based on the determined attribute matching information and the de-duplicated offer data; and\npresent the one or more recommended offers on a display screen viewable by the user.\n12.

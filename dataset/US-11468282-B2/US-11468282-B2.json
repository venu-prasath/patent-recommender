    "abstract": "Disclosed are systems, methods, and non-transitory computer-readable storage media for utilizing a virtual assistant as part of a communication session. One or more of the participant users can select to utilize a virtual assistant to assist the participant users with tasks during the communication session. A user can use a communication application to enter a message directed to the virtual assistant. The virtual assistant can analyze the entered message and determine that the message was directed to the virtual assistant rather than to the other participants of the communication session. As a result, the message will not be transmitted to the other participants of the communication session and the virtual assistant will assist the user with the identified task. A virtual assistant can assist a user with a variety of different tasks. For example, the virtual assistant can gather requested data for the user from one or more web servers, such as weather data, traffic data, etc.",

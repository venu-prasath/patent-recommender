    "title": "Projection type video display apparatus using a progressive scanning mode",
    "abstract": "A projection type video display apparatus prevents resolution of a screen from decreasing by converting a video signal of an interlaced scanning mode received from an outside source to a video signal of a progressive scanning mode. A signal selecting section outputs one of a plurality of video signals received from the outside source in response to a control signal from a control section. A progressive scanning conversion section converts the video signal from the signal selecting section to a video signal of the progressive scanning mode in response to a control signal from the control section. When the video signal from the progressive scanning conversion section is amplified as a red-green-blue signal by means of a cathode-ray tube driving section, a progressive convergence section outputs a progressive convergence signal in order to minimize a difference between incidence angles of each of the red, green and blue components of the red-green-blue signal in response to a control signal from the control section. A cathode-ray tube outputs the red-green-blue signal from the cathode-ray tube driving section in response to the progressive convergence signal. A control section outputs control signals to the signal selecting section, progressive scanning conversion section and progressive convergence section, respectively. Accordingly, a decrease in the resolution of the video displayed on a screen is prevented.",

    "abstract": "A computer-implemented method, system, and computer program product monitors clinical research performance. One or more metrics of clinical research performance for investigator/provider/research sites across research studies are collected. The metrics include performance area, characteristic of the performance area with one or more attributes, point values for each attribute, and weight value for the characteristic. A performance score is produced for each of the entities based on the one or more metrics. A machine learning model is trained to determine performance scores based on the produced performance score for each of the entities. A request for entities is processed by applying performance scores from the machine learning model and appropriate corresponding data to a predictive model to determine resulting performance scores, rank and/or match for each of the one or more entities for a given protocol and/or assessment trigger. Actions are performed based on the resulting performance scores, rank and/or match.",
    "claims": "\n1. A computer-implemented method of monitoring clinical research performance comprising:\ncollecting, via at least one processor, a plurality of metrics of clinical research performance for a plurality of entities across research studies, wherein each metric includes a performance area, a characteristic of the performance area with one or more attributes, point values for each attribute, and a weight value for the characteristic;\nproducing, via the at least one processor, a performance score for each of the plurality of entities based on the plurality of metrics;\ngenerating, via the at least one processor, feature vectors based on the performance areas for the plurality of metrics, past clinical research performance, and reference medical information, wherein the feature vectors include elements corresponding to the performance areas for the plurality of metrics and the performance areas are selected from a group of compliance, ethical conduct, research study history length, enrollment history, research study wide enrollment, experience with different research studies, time to initiate a research study, certifications, and investigator background and expertise;\ntraining, via the at least one processor, a machine learning model with the feature vectors and the produced performance scores for the plurality of entities to determine performance scores based on the produced performance scores for the plurality of entities;\ntraining, via the at least one processor, a machine learning predictive model with the feature vectors and determined performance scores from the machine learning model to determine corresponding entities for conducting clinical research;\nprocessing a request for entities, via the at least one processor, by applying the performance scores for the entities of the request from the machine learning model and feature vectors generated from appropriate corresponding data for the entities of the request from the performance areas for the plurality of metrics, past clinical research performance, and reference medical information to the machine learning predictive model to determine resulting performance scores for the plurality of entities and corresponding entities to conduct the clinical research;\nperforming, via the at least one processor, entity assessment actions based on the resulting performance scores from the machine learning predictive model for the plurality of entities to provide clinical research performance predictions; and\ndisplaying, via the at least one processor, a ranked listing of the clinical research performance predictions using a graphical user interface.\n2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein performing entity assessment actions comprises:\nanalyzing the plurality of metrics producing the resulting performance scores for the plurality of entities and providing recommendations for the plurality of entities to improve corresponding performance scores.\n3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising:\nnormalizing the produced performance scores relative to one or more from a group of a value range for the performance scores, performance scores of individuals within a geographic region, and scores for a quantity of research studies.\n4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising:\nperforming a search for individuals based on performance score and one or more from a group of domain metrics, assessment triggers, and populations.\n5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein performing entity assessment actions comprises:\nreferring an individual to service providers for research studies based on a corresponding resulting performance score."

    "title": "Adaptive ranking system for information retrieval",
    "abstract": "An adaptive record ranking method for full text information retrieval, which quantifies the relevance of retrieved records to query terms occurring in said record. The method utilizes a multilevel weighting technique which permits user input to affect record weighting at each level of the ranking process. The method utilizes weighted attributes of properties of terms occurring in the records of the data base and compensates for the distance between adjacent words of complex terms. The method has been implemented on large full text data bases and the resulting rankings achieve a relatively high level of precision in ranking the relevance of retrieved records to a user query.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for adaptive, multilevel record ranking by a computer system having a monitor for output display of record responses to a query directed to a full-text data base whereby retrieved records are quantitatively ranked with respect to their relevance to the terms of a query, comprising the computer implemented steps of:\nreceiving a set Q of query terms t, wherein a term t may include more than one word, to form a query full-text searching;\nreceiving a plurality of ordered relevance factors to modify said query terms onto a number of levels;\nreceiving, for each relevance factor F, assigned values for attributes of properties of said query terms t which affect the relevance value of any record r to query terms t for each level;\nsearching a full text data base to retrieve records containing said query terms t;\ncalculating, for each query term t, a first relevance weight for each retrieved record r as a function of its occurrence in record r and, for a term having more than one word, the distance between the nearest occurrences of words of said term t in record r;\ncalculating, for each query term t and for each of said attributes, a second relevance weight value for each retrieved record r as a function of said first relevance weight value and said attributes affecting said relevance factor;\ncalculating, for each retrieved record r, a third relevance weight as a function of all of said second relevance weight values for all of said query terms t appearing in said record r;\nusing said third relevance weight as the weight of record r to determine its rank at each level;\nranking all retrieved records according to the quantitative values of said third relevance weights at each level with respect to all query terms in said query Q; and\ndisplaying retrieved records in ranked order.\n2. The method of claim 1 further comprising the steps of:\nreceiving for each relevance factor F, at least one different reassigned value for at least one attribute of properties of said query terms t which affect the relevance value of any record r to query terms t for each level;\nsearching a full text data base to retrieve records containing said query terms t;\nrecalculating successively said first, second and third relevance weights for each level; and\nranking all retrieved records according to the quantitative values of said recalculated third relevance weights at each level, where a successive level gives precedence to a prior level.\n3. The method of claim 1 wherein the step of calculating a first relevance weight further comprises the steps of:\ncounting each occurrence of t as 1, if t is a single word;\ncounting each occurrence of t plus each occurrence of each word in t, where t contains s words, s>1, by counting adjacency occurrences of consecutive pairs of words in term t, where the distance d between occurrences of words in said pairs is 1+ the number of words in between said occurrences, according to the formula: ##EQU6## summing the counts of the s words within term t and the adjacency counts; and\nmultiplying said sum by ##EQU7##\n4. The method of claim 1 wherein the step of calculating a second relevance weight further comprises the steps of:\nreceiving a set of attributes A for each query term t which impact the relevance of that term t for a record r at a level i;\nreceiving, for each attribute a, a coefficient to multiply its value relative to other attributes;\nreceiving, for each attribute a of each term t in record r, a value indicating whether the impact of said attribute is positive, neutral or negative; and\nmultiplying said first calculated relevance weight of each term t in record r by said relevance impact factor of each of said attributes of t, resulting in said second calculated relevance weight.\n5. The method of claim 1 wherein the step of calculating said third relevance weight further comprises the steps of:\nsumming the individual second calculated relevance weights for each attribute of each query term t appearing in record r to obtain the weighted relevance of record r for each level.\n6. The method of claim 3 wherein said set of attributes received as relevance weight functions to quantify a record term includes:\nimportance, the relative weight of term t assigned by the user;\npopularity, the number of records in the text base having term t;\nfrequency, the number of occurrences of term t in a record r;\nrecord id, the identification number of record r;\nword location, the average position of the occurrences of a word of term t in a record r.\n7. The method of claim 4 wherein the step of assigning values to the impact of an attribute of the occurrence of a term t in a record r comprises:\nassigning a value Aj.sbsb.tr if attribute Aj.sbsb.tr has a positive impact on level i;\nassigning a value 1/Aj.sbsb.tr if attribute Aj.sbsb.tr has a negative impact on level i; and\nassigning a value 1 otherwise.\n8. The method of claim 1 wherein the relevance of a record r to a query Q is ##EQU8##",

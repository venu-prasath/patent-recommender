    "abstract": "Methods and systems for determining a ball shot attempt location on a ball court are disclosed. The method includes receiving an input video, where the input video includes the ball shot attempt and one or more players; receiving a declared ball shot attempt; determining a potential shooter by detecting a moving object flow in the input video; determining a potential shooter image region in the image plane by analyzing an overlapping image area of the ball trajectory and the potential shooter; determining a shooter foot-on-court time; determining a most probable pair of shooter legs in the potential shooter image region; determining a shooter foot location based on the most probable pair of shooter legs; and determining a ball shot attempt location on the ball court by applying a camera projection to the shooter foot location.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method for determining a ball shot attempt location on a ball court, comprising:\nreceiving an input video captured using a camera connected to a computing device, wherein the input video comprises the ball shot attempt and one or more players;\nreceiving a declared ball shot attempt, wherein the declared ball shot attempt is detected by analyzing a ball trajectory in the input video using a first machine vision algorithm, and wherein the declared ball shot attempt is associated with a ball shot attempt time;\ndetermining a potential shooter for the declared ball shot attempt by detecting a moving object flow in the input video, from one or more frames backtracked in reverse time from the ball shot attempt time;\ndetermining a potential shooter image region in an image plane by analyzing an overlapping image area of the ball trajectory and the potential shooter;\ndetermining a shooter foot-on-court time;\ndetermining a most probable pair of shooter legs in the potential shooter image region around the shooter foot-on-court time;\ndetermining a shooter foot location based on the most probable pair of shooter legs; and\ndetermining a ball shot attempt location on the ball court by applying a camera projection to the shooter foot location.\n2. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\ndetermining a ball shot attempt result associated with the ball shot attempt; and\nupdating a court-location-indexed shot performance statistics dataset based on the ball shot attempt result.\n3. The method of claim 2, further comprising:\ndetermining a shooter identity as a player having the most probable pair of shooter legs, wherein the updating the court-location-indexed shot performance statistics dataset is further based on the shooter identity.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein the determining the most probable pair of shooter legs comprises:\ndetecting one or more pairs of potential shooter legs of the potential shooter by applying a second machine vision algorithm to one or more frames around the shooter foot-on-court time, within the potential shooter image region; and\nselecting the most probable pair of shooter legs based on a player score, from the one or more pairs of potential shooter legs.\n5. The method of claim 4, wherein the player score is calculated based on whether a player is in a ball moving direction, whether a player is within a projected shooter region, a distance between the ball and a top of a player bound, a distance between a center of the player bound and a center of a cropped image, and/or a historical shooting zone.\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein the determining the shooter foot-on-court time is based on the ball trajectory.\n7. The method of claim 1, wherein the computing device is a mobile computing device.\n8. A non-transitory storage medium storing program code, the program code when executed by a processor, causes the processor to execute a process for determining a ball shot attempt location on a ball court, the program code comprising steps to:\nreceive an input video captured using a camera connected to a computing device, wherein the input video comprises the ball shot attempt and one or more players;\nreceive a declared ball shot attempt, wherein the declared ball shot attempt is detected by analyzing a ball trajectory in the input video using a first machine vision algorithm, and wherein the declared ball shot attempt is associated with a ball shot attempt time;\ndetermine a potential shooter for the declared ball shot attempt by detecting a moving object flow in the input video, from one or more frames backtracked in reverse time from the ball shot attempt time;\ndetermine a potential shooter image region in an image plane by analyzing an overlapping image area of the ball trajectory and the potential shooter;\ndetermine a shooter foot-on-court time;\ndetermine a most probable pair of shooter legs in the potential shooter image region around the shooter foot-on-court time;\ndetermine a shooter foot location based on the most probable pair of shooter legs; and\ndetermine a ball shot attempt location on the ball court by applying a camera projection to the shooter foot location.\n9. The non-transitory storage medium of claim 8, the program code further comprising steps to:\ndetermine a ball shot attempt result associated with the ball shot attempt; and\nupdate a court-location-indexed shot performance statistics dataset based on the ball shot attempt result.\n10. The non-transitory storage medium of claim 9, the program code further comprising steps to:\ndetermine a shooter identity as a player having the most probable pair of shooter legs, wherein the program code to update the court-location-indexed shot performance statistics dataset further utilizes the shooter identity.\n11. The non-transitory storage medium of claim 8, wherein the program code to determine the most probable pair of shooter legs comprises program code to:\ndetect one or more pairs of potential shooter legs of the potential shooter by applying a second machine vision algorithm to one or more frames around the shooter foot-on-court time, within the potential shooter image region; and\nselect the most probable pair of shooter legs based on a player score, from the one or more pairs of potential shooter legs.\n12. The non-transitory storage medium of claim 11, wherein the player score is calculated based on whether a player is in a ball moving direction, whether a player is within a projected shooter region, a distance between the ball and a top of a player bound, a distance between a center of the player bound and a center of a cropped image, and/or a historical shooting zone.\n13. The non-transitory storage medium of claim 8, wherein the program code to determine the shooter foot-on-court time is based on the ball trajectory.\n14. The non-transitory storage medium of claim 8, wherein the computing device is a mobile computing device.\n15. A system comprising a hardware processor and a non-transitory storage medium storing program code, the program code when executed by the hardware processor, causes the hardware processor to execute a process for determining a ball shot attempt location on a ball court, the program code comprising steps to:\nreceive an input video captured using a camera connected to a computing device, wherein the input video comprises the ball shot attempt and one or more players;\nreceive a declared ball shot attempt, wherein the declared ball shot attempt is detected by analyzing a ball trajectory in the input video using a first machine vision algorithm, and wherein the declared ball shot attempt is associated with a ball shot attempt time;\ndetermine a potential shooter for the declared ball shot attempt by detecting a moving object flow in the input video, from one or more frames backtracked in reverse time from the ball shot attempt time;\ndetermine a potential shooter image region in an image plane by analyzing an overlapping image area of the ball trajectory and the potential shooter;\ndetermine a shooter foot-on-court time;\ndetermine a most probable pair of shooter legs in the potential shooter image region around the shooter foot-on-court time;\ndetermine a shooter foot location based on the most probable pair of shooter legs; and\ndetermine a ball shot attempt location on the ball court by applying a camera projection to the shooter foot location.\n16. The system of claim 15, the program code further comprising steps to:\ndetermine a ball shot attempt result associated with the ball shot attempt; and\nupdate a court-location-indexed shot performance statistics dataset based on the ball shot attempt result.\n17.

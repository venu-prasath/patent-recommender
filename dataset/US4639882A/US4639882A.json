    "title": "Monitoring system",
    "abstract": "A system for monitoring data signals representing a number of parameters of a plant or apparatus, periodically superimposes test signals on to some of the data signals so as to produce combined signals representing unacceptable states of the parameters. The selection of the data signals on which the test signals are superimposed is changed at each periodic examination in a predetermined sequence, so that a pattern of acceptable and unacceptable signals is produced as an output to be compared with a reference pattern.",

    "claims": "\n1. A system for monitoring a plurality of data signals from a plant or apparatus, each data signal representing a parameter of the plant or apparatus, the system comprising, means for periodically examining the data signals and for providing output signals representing whether each data signal represents an acceptable or an unacceptable state of the respective parameter, and means for supplying test signals to be superimposed on selected said data signals before each periodic examination thereof such as to produce corresponding combined signals equivalent to data signals representing the unacceptable state, the selection of the data signals on which the test signals are superimposed being changed for each periodic examination of the data signals within a predetermined sequence so that the examining means produces a recognisable pattern of said output signals.\n2. A monitoring system as claimed in claim 1 wherein each output signal represents whether a monitored variable determined from the values of a number of the data signals lies within acceptable limits or not, the number being at least two.\n3. A monitoring system as claimed in claim 2 wherein the selection of data signals is such that, for at least one periodic examination, test signals are superimposed on two of the said number of the data signals and are such that the monitored variable should lie within the acceptable limits.\n4. A monitoring system as claimed in claim 2 further comprising memory means for storing the values of the data signals, and wherein the test signal supply means includes a signal generating means arranged to generate the test signals in relation to the stored values of the data signals.\n5. A monitoring system as claimed in claim 1 further comprising memory means for storing the values of the data signals, and wherein the test signal supply means includes a signal generating means arranged to generate the test signals in relation to the stored values of the data signals.\n6. A monitoring system as claimed in claim 1 wherein, after an integral number of the periodic examinations of the data signals, the pattern is repeated.\n7. A monitoring system as claimed in claim 6 arranged such that at least one test signal is superimposed on each data signal during the said number of the periodic examinations of the data signals.\n8. A monitoring system as claimed in claim 6 wherein the test signals superimposed on any one of the data signals during the said number of the periodic examinations, are such that the mean value of the corresponding combined signals is equivalent to the value of the said one data signal.\n9. A monitoring system as claimed in claim 1 wherein the selection of data signals on which the test signals are superimposed is such as to cause a pattern of output signals, represented as a series of digits, which is of a form which can be generated from a sequence of n digits, successive groups of n digits being generated by sequentially shifting one place at a time n places to the right and then n places to the left and at each shift moving the digit at the end toward which the shift occurs to the other end of the group.\n10. A monitoring system as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a pattern recognition means arranged to receive the said output signals and to compare the pattern with a reference pattern.\n11. Apparatus for monitoring a plurality of parameters of a plant or apparatus comprising, a number of monitoring systems as claimed in claim 1, each parameter being represented by as many data signals as there are monitoring systems and each data signal being monitored by a respective monitoring system, a voting means arranged to receive the output signals from each monitoring system and to produce a signal representing the majority value of the output signals received, and a pattern recognition means arranged to receive the signals from the voting means and to compare the pattern of the received signals with a reference pattern, and to provide a signal indicating whether the patterns are the same.\n12. An apparatus as claimed in claim 11 comprising a plurality of voting means, each voting means being arranged to receive the output signals from each monitoring system; a plurality of pattern recognition means, each arranged to receive the signals from a respective voting means; and a final voting means arranged to receive the signals from all the pattern recognition means.\n13. A method of monitoring a plurality of data signals from a plant or apparatus, each data signal representing a parameter of the plant or apparatus, the method comprising periodically examining each data signal and providing an output signal representing whether the data signal represents an acceptable or an unacceptable state of the respective parameter, and superimposing test signals on selected said data signals before each periodic examination thereof such as to produce corresponding combined signals equivalent to data signals representing the unacceptable state, the selection of the data signals on which the test signals are superimposed being changed within a predetermined sequence so that a recognisable pattern of the output signals is produced.",

    "claims": "\n1. A computerized method being implemented via execution of computing instructions to run on one or more processors and stored at one or more non-transitory computer-readable media, the computerized method comprising:\ngenerating a first search result in response to a first user query by a user searching for a first item, the first search result depicting the first item;\ngenerating two or more second search results in response to two or more second user queries searching for two or more second items of a different kind, the two or more second search results depicting the two or more second items; and\nmodifying the first search result by generating a combination image that depicts user-defined subject matter engaging with the first item, wherein the combination image further depicts the user-defined subject matter simultaneously engaging with the two or more second items of the different kind.\n2. The computerized method of claim 1, wherein:\nthe first search result comprises a plurality of first search results that each depict a respective different instance of the first item; and\nthe combination image is generated for each of the plurality of first search results to produce a plurality of respective combination images that each depict the user-defined subject matter engaging with one of the respective different instances of the first item.\n3. The computerized method of claim 2, further comprising calibration, normalization and resizing of the plurality of first search results, wherein the plurality of respective combination images have a same (i) size or (ii) resolution.\n4. The computerized method of claim 1, wherein:\nthe first search result comprises one or more image-based search results that each depict a different instance of the first item; and\nthe combination image is generated for the one or more image-based search results to produce one or more respective combination images that each depict the user wearing one of the different instances of the first item.\n5. The computerized method of claim 1, wherein the user-defined subject matter comprises a person, a place, and a thing.\n6. The computerized method of claim 5, wherein the person comprises the user and a user-selected third party.\n7. The computerized method of claim 6, wherein the first item comprises an item worn by the user and the user-selected third party.\n8. The computerized method of claim 6, wherein the first item is selected from the group consisting of clothing articles, accessories, and other items worn by the person.\n9. The computerized method of claim 8, wherein the accessories are selected from the group consisting of jewelry, eyewear, cosmetics, timepieces, piercing items, purses, bags, hand bags, suitcases, and other carriables.\n10. The computerized method of claim 5, wherein the place or the thing is selected from the group consisting of indoor structures, outdoor structures, and locations.\n11. The computerized method of claim 10, wherein the first item comprises an item that can be placed on or in the indoor structures, the outdoor structures, and the locations.\n12. The computerized method of claim 11, wherein the first item is selected from the group consisting of furniture, carpeting, and pieces of art.\n13. The computerized method of claim 1, wherein the user-defined subject matter is defined by receiving an input that comprises an image of the user-defined subject matter.\n14. The computerized method of claim 1, wherein the user-defined subject matter is defined by receiving an input that comprises a specification of one or more characteristics of the user-defined subject matter.\n15. The computerized method of claim 1, further comprising modifying the combination image in response to receiving an input to switch from a first user-defined subject matter engaging with the first item to a second user-defined subject matter engaging with the first item.\n16. The computerized method of claim 1, wherein:\nthe first item comprises a clothing article, an accessory, and another item worn by a person.\n17. The computerized method of claim 1, further comprising generating one or more user interface elements to be displayed in conjunction with the combination image.\n18. The computerized method of claim 17, wherein the one or more user interface elements comprise one or more link elements for enabling the user to perform one or more operations involving the first item displayed in the combination image, the one or more operations being selected from the group consisting of accessing a source of the first item, adding the first item to a shopping cart, and purchasing the first item.\n19. The computerized method of claim 1, wherein the combination image is selected from the group consisting of two-dimensional images, three-dimensional images, three-dimensional models, videos, and animations.\n20. The computerized method of claim 1, wherein the combination image incorporates a background of an image of the user-defined subject matter.\n21. The computerized method of claim 1, further comprising filtering the first search result or the first user query based on information determined from computer image-analysis of a user-specified image that depicts the user-defined subject matter.\n22. The computerized method of claim 21, wherein the user-defined subject matter comprises a person, a place or a thing, and the information determined from the computer image-analysis of the user-specified image comprises information about one or more size dimensions of the person, the place, or the thing, and wherein the first search result or the first user query is modified to exclude items that are not compatible with or relevant to the one or more size dimensions.\n23. The computerized method of claim 21, wherein the first item comprises clothing and the information is used to limit the first search result based on a clothing size or a clothing style.\n24. A system comprising:\none or more processors operably coupled to one or more non-transitory computer-readable media storing computing instructions configured to be run on the one or more processors to perform:\ngenerating a first search result in response to a first user query by a user searching for a first item, the first search result depicting the first item;\ngenerating two or more second search results in response to two or more second user queries searching for two or more second items of a different kind, the two or more second search results depicting the two or more second items; and\nmodifying the first search result by generating a combination image that depicts user-defined subject matter engaging with the first item, wherein the combination image further depicts the user-defined subject matter simultaneously engaging with the two or more second items of the different kind.\n25. A computer program product comprising:\none or more non-transitory computer-readable data storage media;\ncomputing instructions stored on the one or more non-transitory computer-readable data storage media and executable by one or more processors to perform:\nreceiving a first search result in response to a first user query by a user that searches for a first item;\nreceiving two or more second search results in response to two or more second user queries searching for two or more second items of a different kind, the two or more second search results depicting the two or more second items; and\nmodifying the first search result by replacing the first search result with a combination image that depicts user-defined subject matter engaging with the first item, wherein the combination image further depicts the user-defined subject matter simultaneously engaging with the two or more second items of the different kind."

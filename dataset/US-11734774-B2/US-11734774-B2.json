    "abstract": "Systems and methods for crowdsourcing data collection for condition classification of bond entities are disclosed. An example system may include a crowdsourcing data collection circuit to collect information about entities involved in a set of bond transactions and a training data set of outcomes related to the entities. The example system may include a condition classifying circuit to classify a condition of a set of issuers using the information from the crowdsourcing data collection circuit and a model, where the model is trained using the training data set of outcomes related to the set of issuers. The example system may also include an automated agent circuit to perform an action related to a debt transaction in response to the classified condition of at least one issuer of the set of issuers.",
    "claims": "\n1. A system, comprising:\na crowdsourcing data collection circuit structured to:\ncollect information about entities involved in a set of bond transactions and a training data set of outcomes related to the entities;\nprovide a user interface by which a user configures a crowdsourcing request for issuer information relevant to a condition of a set of issuers of a set of bonds; and\nreceive the issuer information from a set of devices of a respective set of information suppliers;\na condition classifying circuit structured to:\ntrain a classification model using the training data set of outcomes related to the entities; and\nclassify the condition of the set of issuers using the issuer information received by the crowdsourcing data collection circuit and the classification model; and\nan automated agent circuit structured to:\nprocess events relevant to at least one of a value, a condition, or an ownership of at least one asset of at least one issuer of the set of issuers; and\nperform an action related to a debt transaction in response to at least one of the processed events and the classified condition, wherein the action includes underwriting the debt transaction.\n2. The system of claim 1, wherein the condition classified by the condition classifying circuit is at least one of: a default condition, a foreclosure condition, a condition indicating violation of a covenant, a financial risk condition, a behavioral risk condition, a policy risk condition, a financial health condition, a physical defect condition, a physical health condition, an entity risk condition, or an entity health condition.\n3. The system of claim 1, further comprising a configurable data collection and monitoring circuit structured to monitor at least one issuer from the set of issuers, wherein the configurable data collection and monitoring circuit includes at least one of: Internet of Things devices, a set of environmental condition sensors, a set of social network analytic services, or a set of algorithms for querying network domains.\n4. The system of claim 3, wherein a set of bonds associated with the set of bond transactions is backed by a set of assets.\n5. The system of claim 1, wherein the action further includes at least one of: offering a debt transaction, setting an interest rate, deferring a payment requirement, modifying an interest rate, validating title, managing inspection, recording a change in title, assessing the value of an asset, calling a loan, closing a transaction, setting terms and conditions for a transaction, providing notices required to be provided, foreclosing on a set of assets, modifying terms and conditions, setting a rating for an entity, syndicating debt, or consolidating debt.\n6. The system of claim 1, wherein the condition classifying circuit includes at least one of: a machine learning system, a rule-based system, a deep learning system, a hybrid system, a neural network, a convolutional neural network, a feed forward neural network, a feedback neural network, a self-organizing map, a fuzzy logic system, a random walk system, a random forest system, a probabilistic system, a Bayesian system, or a simulation system.\n7. The system of claim 1, further comprising an automated bond management circuit configured to manage an action related to a bond related to the at least one issuer of the set of issuers, and wherein the automated bond management circuit is trained on a training set of bond management activities.\n8. The system of claim 7, wherein the automated bond management circuit is further trained on a set of interactions of parties with a set of user interfaces involved in a set of bond transaction activities.\n9. The system of claim 1, further comprising a market value data collection circuit structured to monitor and report on marketplace information relevant to a value of the at least one issuer of the set of issuers or a set of assets.\n10. The system of claim 9, wherein the market value data collection circuit is structured to monitor pricing or financial data for items that are similar to at least one asset of the set of assets in at least one public marketplace.\n11. The system of claim 10, wherein the market value data collection circuit is further structured to construct a set of similar items for valuing the set of assets using a similarity clustering algorithm based on attributes of the at least one asset.\n12. The system of claim 11, wherein at least one of the attributes is at least one of: a category of the at least one asset, an age of the at least one asset, a condition of the at least one asset, a history of the at least one asset, a storage of the at least one asset, or a geolocation of the at least one asset.\n13. The system of claim 1, further comprising a smart contract circuit structured for managing a smart contract for a bond transaction in response to the classified condition of the set of issuers, wherein the smart contract circuit is structured to determine a set of terms and conditions for the bond transaction.\n14. A method, comprising:\nmaintaining, via one or more processors, a training data set of outcomes related to previous bond transactions and respective information of one or more respective entities involved in the previous bond transactions;\ncollecting, via the one or more processors, information about a set of issuers involved in a set of bond transactions of a set of bonds;\ntraining a classification model using the training data set;\nclassifying, via the one or more processors, a condition of the set of issuers using the collected information and the classification model; and\nexecuting, via the one or more processors, a recording of a change in title action related to a debt transaction in response to the classified condition of the set of issuers.\n15. The method of claim 14, further comprising:\nprocessing, via the one or more processors, events relevant to at least one of a value, a condition, and an ownership of at least one asset related to at least one issuer of the set of issuers.\n16. The method of claim 14, further comprising:\nmanaging, via the one or more processors, an action related to a bond related to at least one issuer of the set of issuers based on, at least in part, a training set of bond management activities.\n17. The method of claim 14, further comprising:\nmonitoring and reporting, via the one or more processors, on marketplace information relevant to a value of at least one of: at least one issuer of the set of issuers or a set of assets.\n18. The method of claim 14, further comprising:\nmanaging, via the one or more processors, a smart contract for a bond transaction; and\ndetermining, via the one or more processors, terms and conditions for the smart contract for at least one bond.",

    "abstract": "The present system includes a computer-networked system that allows mobile subscribers, and others, to submit mobile applications to be analyzed for anomalous and malicious behavior using data acquired during the execution of the application within a highly instrumented and controlled environment for which the analysis relies on per-execution as well as comparative aggregate data across many such executions from one or more subscribers.",
    "claims": "\n1-45. (canceled)\n46. A system for assessing the quality of mobile applications, the system comprising:\nat least one memory storing computer-executable instructions; and\nat least one processing unit for executing the instructions store in memory, wherein execution of the instructions results in one or more applications together comprising:\na webserver component for receiving requests to analyze one or more mobile applications;\na controller component for scheduling the received requests;\na dispatcher module for providing a sandbox suitable for executing the request based on one or more criteria associated with the request and executing the request within the sandbox; and\na database component for storing data resulting from the execution of the request.\n47. The system of claim 46 wherein the dispatcher module further collects and analyzes data and metadata associated with the mobile applications, collects logs and measurements during execution of the request; summarizes the logs and measurements, and generates an analysis vector based on the summarized logs and measurements.\n48. The system of claim 47 wherein the dispatcher module further provides analysis of the analysis vector, classifies the analysis vector, predicts a behavior of the mobile application based on the classification, and produces a report of the predicted behavior.\n49. The system of claim 47 wherein the dispatcher module further aggregates data from logs and measurements collected from one or more executed requests and generates a visual analysis of said executions including visualization of network behavior across the network over time.\n50. The system of claim 46 wherein execution of the instructions further results in a collection of plug-in components providing alternative analysis environments selected from the group comprising a hardware-based sandbox and a third party anti-virus scanner.\n51. The system of claim 46 wherein execution of the instructions further results in a dashboard component, wherein the dashboard provides real-time monitoring and evaluation of the performance of a cloud-based service workflow implementing the system.\n52. The system of claim 51 wherein the monitoring and evaluation is based on one or more selection criteria selected from the group comprising: a specified time range, a submission source, a static characteristic of binaries of the mobile applications and behavioral characteristics of binaries of the mobile applications.\n53. The system of claim 46 wherein execution of the request comprises performing autonomous risk assessment inferences on the mobile application binary code via static analysis one the application binary code by applying one or more risk assessment rules during the execution of the request.\n54. The system of claim 53 wherein the risk assessment rules comprise one or more of: one or more independent search terms, a risk assessment category, a risk explanation, and a risk score.\n55. The system of claim 54 wherein evaluating one or more of said risk assessment rules against said application binary comprises:\ngenerating a comprehensive document model partition list of a bytecode of an application binary by partitioning the bytecode based on one or more criteria selected from the group comprising: functions, methods, constants, strings, manifests, permissions, attachment files, and headers;\nretrieving a risk assessment rule comprising N independent search terms;\nfor each search term in a rule, performing a search against the partition list to determine a set of code basic blocks on which the search term is asserted;\nretrieving the results of up to N independent search results;\nidentifying and retrieving an intersection of the resulting sets;\nclaiming a risk assessment rule to be activated based on a resulting non-null intersection;\ncalculating an overall risk score for each of a plurality of risk categories based on a contribution to the score of each activated risk assessment rule;\ngrouping risk assessment rules into risk categories; and\ngenerating a category-based accrued risk assessment vector for the mobile application binary.\n56. The system of claim 55 further comprising comparing said category-based accrued risk assessment vector for a given application binary against previously computed vectors of a previously analyzed set of application binaries identifying anomalies and similarities on category-based accrued risk vectors and reporting results of the analysis.\n57. The system of claim 56 wherein the comparison of category-based accrued risk assessment vectors is performed using at least one comparison technique selected from the group of clustering and anomaly detection.\n58. The system of claim 56 wherein the webserver component, the controller component, the dispatcher module and the database component are provided via a cloud-based service and wherein the database component accumulates analysis results from one or more submission sources.\n59. The system of claim 55 where the selection of the set of risk assessment rules of interest to be evaluated and the associated risk scores is based on criteria set by one or more of individual preferences of end-users users and enterprise administrators."

    "title": "Method and apparatus for signal bandwidth compression utilizing the fourier transform of the logarithm of the frequency spectrum magnitude",
    "abstract": "A bandwidth compression system such as a digital vocoder including an analysis section employs a transducer to convert an input speech wave into an electrical signal which is then digitized by an analog to digital converter. The digitized signal is directed through a spectrum device where the magnitudes of the frequency spectrum of the input speech wave are obtained. These magnitudes are then directed to a logging circuit to obtain the logarithm of the frequency spectrum magnitudes of the input speech signal. The logged magnitudes of the frequency spectrum are then directed to a computer where the discrete Fourier transform of the logged spectrum magnitudes are obtained to form the Fourier transform of the logarithm of the frequency spectrum magnitude (FTLSM) of the input speech signal. An encoding unit selects and encodes certain ones of the FTLSM coefficients for transmission to a remote terminal for analysis. The encoded signals include pitch data and vocal tract impulse data, both of which are derived from the FTLSM signals. The analysis section of a vocoder terminal employs a decoding device which decodes the received data and separates it into pitch data and vocal tract impulse data. Connected to the decoding device is a computing device for computing the logarithm of the spectrum envelope of the vocal tract impulse response function using the discrete Fourier transform. The logged spectrum is directed through a delogging device to a fast Fourier transform (FET) computer where the Fourier sine transform of the received spectrum signals (the impulse response) are obtained. A convolution unit then convolves the pitch data with the impulse response data to yield the desired synthesized speech signal.",

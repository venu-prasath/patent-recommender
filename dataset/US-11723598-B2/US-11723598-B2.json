The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the processing unit is configured to render the first instance of the primary task with the interference by configuring the user interface to:\nrender the first instance of the primary task in the presence of the interference such that the interference diverts the individual's attention from the primary task, in which the interference is rendered as one or both of a distraction or an interruptor.\n6. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the processing unit is configured to control the user interface to render the interference as a target discrimination interference.\n7. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein one or both of the primary task or interference comprises a targeting task.\n8. The apparatus of claim 7 wherein the targeting task is a target discriminating task.\n9. The apparatus of claim 7 wherein modifying the time-varying aspect of one or both of the primary task or the interference comprises modifying a trajectory of motion of a target object.\n10. A system for training cognitive skills in an individual, comprising:\na user interface comprising a display and an input device;\na non-transitory computer readable memory comprising processor-executable instructions stored thereon; and\na processing unit communicatively engaged with the user interface and the non-transitory computer readable memory, wherein upon execution of the processor-executable instructions by the processing unit, the processing unit is configured to:\nrender a first instance of a primary task with an interference at a graphical user interface being displayed at the display of the user interface, wherein the primary task comprises one or more first computerized stimuli or interaction comprising one or more graphical objects configured to prompt a first response from the individual to the first instance of the primary task in the presence of the interference via the input device of the user interface;\nwherein the interference comprises one or both of an interruptor or a distraction, wherein the interruptor or the distraction comprises one or more additional graphical objects configured to divert the individual's attention from performing the primary task;\nrender a second instance of the primary task without the interference at the user interface, wherein the second instance of the primary task without the interference is configured to require a second response from the individual to the second instance of the primary task;\nwherein the processing unit is configured to:\n(i) receive a secondary response to the interference at substantially the same time as the processing unit receives the second response; or\n(ii) receive the secondary response to the interference that is an interruptor at substantially the same time as the processing unit receives the first response and not receive the secondary response to the interference that is a distraction at substantially the same time that the processing unit receives the first response;\nreceive data indicative of the first response and the second response; and\nmodify a time-varying aspect of one or both of the primary task or the interference in response to receiving the data indicative of the first response and the second response, wherein modifying the time-varying aspect of one or both of the primary task or the interference comprises modifying one or more of a speed of an object, a rate of change of a facial expression, a direction of trajectory of an object, a change of orientation of an object, at least one color of an object, a type of an object, or a size of an object.\n11.

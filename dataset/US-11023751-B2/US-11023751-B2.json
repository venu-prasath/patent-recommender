    "abstract": "A method for safe route determination, including determining a geographic risk map for a geographic region, wherein the geographic risk map is determined based on a vehicle event dataset aggregated from a plurality of vehicles enabled with an onboard vehicle system, and automatically determining a route between two locations in the geographic region based on the geographic risk map.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method comprising:\nobtaining near-collision information regarding one or more near-collision events that occur within a geographic region, and/or obtaining collision information regarding one or more collision events that occur within the geographic region, wherein the geographic region defines a spatial zone;\ncomputing a risk score associated with the spatial zone based on the near-collision information regarding the one or more of the near-collision events and/or based on the collision information regarding the one or more of the collision events;\ncomputing a route risk score for a candidate route that intersects the spatial zone, wherein the candidate route is between an origin located within the geographic region and a destination located within the geographic region, wherein the route risk score is computed by:\ndetermining a weight corresponding with the spatial zone,\ngenerating a weighted zone risk score based at least in part on the weight and the zone risk score associated with the spatial zone, and\ndetermining the route risk score based on the weighted zone risk score; and\ndetermining the candidate rout as a safe route between the origin and the destination based on a satisfaction of a criterion;\nwherein the safe route is for routing.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein the spatial zone is one of a plurality of spatial zones defined by the geographic region, and wherein a first subset of the spatial zones is associated with a roadways-junction, and a second subset of the spatial zones is associated with a roadway.\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein the weight is proportional to a number of roadways.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein the candidate route has multiple route portions, and wherein the weight is proportional to a length of one of the route portions intersecting the spatial zone.\n5. The method of claim 1, wherein the weight corresponds with an estimated residence time for the spatial zone.\n6. The method of claim 5, further comprising estimating the residence time based on a traffic condition.\n7. The method of claim 1, wherein the zone risk score corresponds with a frequency of a subset of the one or more near-collision events within the spatial zone, and/or a frequency of a subset of the one or more collision events within the spatial zone.\n8. The method of claim 1, further comprising detecting one of the one or more near-collision events, wherein the act of detecting comprises:\nobtaining a first video with a first camera;\ndetecting an object from the first video;\ndetermining an object parameter for the object from the first video;\nobtaining a second video with a second camera;\ndetermining a user behavior score based on the second video; and\ngenerating a risk map, the risk map comprising risk map scores, at least one of the risk map scores calculated based on the user behavior score and the object parameter.\n9. The method of claim 1, wherein the candidate route is one of multiple candidate routes, and wherein the act of determining the safe route between the origin and the destination comprises:\nreceiving a user input;\nfiltering the candidate routes based on the user input; and\nselecting one of the filtered candidate routes satisfying the criterion as the safe route.\n10. A method comprising:\nobtaining near-collision data regarding one or more near-collision events that occur within a geographic region, and/or obtaining collision data regarding one or more collision events that occur within the geographic region, wherein at least one of the one or more near-collision events or at least one of the one or more collision events is detected using an onboard vehicle system, and wherein the geographic region defines spatial zones;\naggregating the near-collision data and/or the collision data into a vehicle event dataset;\ndetermining a geographic risk map based on the vehicle event dataset, wherein the geographic risk map comprises zone risk scores associated respectively with the spatial zones;\ndetermining a safe route between a location and a destination based on the geographic risk map;\nwherein the safe route is for routing.\n11. The method of claim 10, further comprising determining a vehicle context parameter, wherein the safe route is determined based on the geographic risk map in combination with the vehicle context parameter.\n12. The method of claim 11, wherein the vehicle context parameter is determined based on a first video generated by a first camera, and a second video generated by a second camera.\n13. The method of claim 12, wherein the act of determining the vehicle context parameter comprises extracting an object position as a function of time from the first video, extracting a driver gaze direction as a function of time from the second video, and computing a driver behavior score based on the driver gaze direction and the object position.\n14. The method of claim 11, wherein the act of determining the vehicle context parameter comprises determining a driver identity, and retrieving a driver behavior score associated with the driver identity.\n15. The method of claim 10, further comprising:\nreceiving a safe route request for a vehicle, the safe route request comprising the location and the destination; and\nretrieving the geographic risk map;\nwherein the safe route between the location and the destination is determined based on the geographic risk map for routing the vehicle.\n16. The method of claim 10, wherein one of the zone risk scores is computed based on a near-collision frequency and/or a collision frequency.\n17. The method of claim 16, wherein one of the spatial zones defines a roadway feature, and wherein the zone risk score of the one of the spatial zones is computed based on the roadway feature.\n18. The method of claim 17, wherein the roadway feature comprises a speed limit.\n19. The method of claim 10, further comprising detecting the at least one of the one or more near-collision events, wherein the act of detecting comprises:\nobtaining a first video with a first camera;\ndetecting an object from the first video;\ndetermining an object parameter for the object from the first video;\nobtaining a second video with a second camera;\ndetermining a user behavior score based on the second video; and\ngenerating a local risk map, the local risk map comprising risk map scores, at least one of the risk map scores calculated based on the user behavior score and object parameter.\n20. The method of claim 10, wherein the act of determining the safe route comprises determining a candidate route intersecting at least a subset of the spatial zones, and determining a route risk score for the candidate route, wherein the act of determining the route risk score for the candidate route comprises:\ndetermining a weight for one of the spatial zones,\ngenerating a weighted zone risk score based on a zone risk score associated with the one of the spatial zones and the weight, and\ndetermining the route risk score based on the weighted zone risk score;\nwherein the candidate route is determined as the safe route upon a satisfaction of a criterion.",

    "abstract": "Examples of the present disclosure describe systems and methods relating to generating relevance scores for one or more words of a passage which is an answer to a natural language query. For instance, a passage extracted from a highly relevant electronic file along with the query may encoded and augmented to generate a multi-dimensional, augmented semantic vectors using recurring neural networks. The augmented semantic vectors along with a multi-dimensional vector that represent words of the passage may be decoded to generate relevance scores for one or more words of the passage, based on levels of relevance to the query.",

    "abstract": "A staple cartridge for use with a stapling device that has an actuator that is selectively actuatable in an axial direction and an anvil portion that is selectively movable between open and closed positions is disclosed. Various embodiments of the present invention include a cartridge body that movably supports first and second staple drivers. The staple drivers each support a staple thereon and serve to drive the staples into forming contact with the anvil upon actuation by the actuator. The various embodiments of the present invention enable the final formed heights of the staples to be varied so as to apply various clamping forces and pressures to soft tissue captured within the staples. In at least one embodiment, the staples can include crowns formed thereon which can be utilized to adjust or control the clamping force and/or pressure applied by the staples.",
    "claims": "\n1. A surgical staple cartridge, comprising:\na cartridge housing;\na cartridge deck comprising a first section and a second section spaced apart from the first section, wherein the first section extends alongside the second section;\na first row of staple pockets at the first section of the cartridge deck;\na second row of staple pockets at the first section of the cartridge deck;\na third row of staple pockets at the first section of the cartridge deck;\na plurality of first staples removably stored within the first row of staple pockets;\na plurality of second staples removably stored within the second row of staple pockets;\na plurality of third staples removably stored within the third row of staple pockets;\na first staple driver oriented to drive a first staple out of the staple pockets in the first row, a second staple out of the staple pockets in the second row, and a third staple out of the staple pockets in the third row; and\na second staple driver oriented to drive a total of four staples out of the staple pockets in the first row, the second row and the third row of staple pockets and, in cooperation with an opposing anvil, deform at least one of said four staples to a first fired height and at least one of said four staples to a second fired height, wherein the first fired height is different than the second fired height.\n2. The surgical staple cartridge of claim 1, wherein said first fired height is shorter than said second fired height.\n3. The surgical staple cartridge of claim 2, wherein said first row of staple pockets defines an inner row of staple pockets.\n4. The surgical staple cartridge of claim 1, wherein said cartridge deck comprises a proximal end and a distal end, wherein a knife channel extends between said proximal end and said distal end, and wherein a knife is slidable longitudinally between said proximal end and said distal end.\n5. The surgical staple cartridge of claim 1, wherein each said first staple comprises a base, a first leg, and a second leg, wherein said first leg extends non-parallely to said second leg.\n6. An end effector for use with a surgical instrument, said end effector comprising:\nan anvil;\na cartridge housing;\na cartridge deck comprising a first section and a second section spaced apart from the first section, wherein the first section extends alongside the second section;\na first row of staple pockets at the first section of the cartridge deck;\na second row of staple pockets at the first section of the cartridge deck;\na third row of staple pockets at the first section of the cartridge deck;\na plurality of first staples removably stored within said first row of staple pockets;\na plurality of second staples removably stored within said second row of staple pockets;\na plurality of third staples removably stored within said third row of staple pockets; and\na staple driver arranged to drive a total of four staples, wherein said four staples comprise at least one staple from said first row, at least one staple from said second row and at least one staple from said third row and, in cooperation with said anvil, deform at least one of said four staples to a first fired height and at least one of said four staples to a second fired height, wherein said first fired height is different than said second fired height.\n7. The end effector of claim 6, wherein said first fired height is shorter than said second fired height.\n8. The end effector of claim 7, wherein said first row of staple pockets is adjacent a knife channel.\n9. The end effector of claim 6, wherein the cartridge deck comprises a proximal end and a distal end, wherein the first section extends alongside the second section from the proximal end to the distal end.\n10. The end effector of claim 6, wherein each said first staple comprises a base, a first leg, and a second leg, wherein said first leg extends non-parallelly to said second leg.\n11. A surgical end effector, comprising:\na cartridge housing;\na cartridge deck comprising a first section and a second section spaced apart from the first section, wherein the first section extends alongside the second section;\na first row of staple pockets at the first section of the cartridge deck, wherein the first row of staple pockets defines an inner row of staple pockets;\na second row of staple pockets at the first section of the cartridge deck, wherein the second row of staple pockets is adjacent to the first row of staple pockets, and wherein the staple pockets in the first row of staple pockets are staggered distally with respect to the staple pockets in the second row of staple pockets;\na third row of staple pockets at the first section of the cartridge deck;\nstaples removably positioned within the staple pockets;\na first staple driver arranged to drive a first staple out of the staple pockets in the first row, a second staple out of the staple pockets in the second row, and a third staple out of the staple pockets in the third row; and\na second staple driver arranged to drive a total of four staples.\n12. The end effector of claim 11, wherein one of said four staples is deformed to a first fired height and another of said four staples is deformed to a second fired height, and wherein said first fired height is shorter than said second fired height.\n13. The end effector of claim 12, wherein said first row of staple pockets defines an inner row of staple pockets.\n14. The end effector of claim 11, wherein the cartridge deck comprises a proximal end and a distal end, and wherein the first section extends alongside the second section from the proximal end to the distal end.\n15. The end effector of claim 11, wherein each said first staple comprises a base, a first leg, and a second leg, wherein said first leg extends non-parallelly to said second leg."

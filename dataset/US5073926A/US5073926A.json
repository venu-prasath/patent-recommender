    "claims": "\n1. In a two-way communication system including first and second communication terminals, telephone means at each terminal for two-way telephone service and picture communication means at each terminal for providing users with visual images of each other, each said picture communication means comprising:\ncamera means for generating video signals to be transmitted;\ndisplay means for displaying the visual images;\ncontrol means for controlling transmission and reception of said video signals; and\nline drawing input means for generating a line drawing signal representing a line drawing and which includes tablet means adapted to have said line drawing drawn thereon by the respective user, coordinates data detecting means for detecting absolute coordinates data in parallel form, coordinates converting means for converting said absolute coordinates data detected by said coordinates data detecting means to relative coordinates data, and parallel-to-serial converting means for outputting the relative coordinates data in serial form to said control means so as to be suitable for transmission with said video signals from said control means.\n2. A two-way communication system according to claim 1, wherein said line drawing input means further includes auxiliary display means comprised of liquid crystal devices, a body housing said tablet means and said auxiliary display means, video memory means for storing video data supplied to said auxiliary display means, and means supplied with said relative coordinates data in serial form as the video data to be stored in said video memory means.\n3. A two-way communication system according to claim 2, wherein said line drawing input means further includes superimposing means for superimposing the video data stored in said video memory means on said video signal generated by said camera means of one of said first and second communication terminals.\n4. A two-way communication system according to claim 2, wherein said coordinates data are X and Y coordinates, and said line drawing input means further includes means for renewing the video data each time one of said X and Y coordinates data changes its level.\n5. A two-way communication system according to claim 1, wherein said control means includes mode selecting means for selecting one of a first display mode for displaying said line drawing only on said display means and a second display mode for displaying a superimposed image of said line drawing and the image represented by said video signals on said display means.\n6. A two-way communication system according to claim 5, wherein said mode selecting means is further capable of selecting a third display mode for displaying said line drawing on a main display area of said display means and for displaying the image represented by said video signals on a sub display area of said display means.",

    "title": "Image signal encoding apparatus and method for controlling quantization step size in accordance with frame skip numbers",
    "abstract": "An image signal encoding apparatus having a control means for detecting a degree of redundancy of an inputted image signal and for conducting frame skip control based on a frame skip number determination and a determined skip number, an encoding processing means for processing a frame signal indicated by a transmission from said control means by block units into which a screen is divided, quantizing this signal, and encoding and outputting this signal through the medium of a transmission buffer, and a step size control means for controlling the step size of the quantization, characterized in that the step size control means comprises a correction buffer amount calculation means, which calculates a correction buffer amount indicating an excess in the transmission buffer from the frame skip number and a previously supplied transmission speed, and a step size calculation means, which outputs a quantization step size which is smaller as the correction buffer amount indicates a larger excess of the transmission buffer.",

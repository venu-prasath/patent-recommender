    "title": "Dynamic reconstruction method for discrimination network",
    "abstract": "A dynamic network reconstruction method in which the node processing information such as a node processing volume and a ratio at which a node is satisfied is collected for all nodes to maintain an efficient network even when the characteristic of an object described in a condition clause is changed in a Rete network of a production system using the knowledge technology and the network is changed based on the node processing information.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for dynamically reconstructing a network in a system in which a determination of whether or not a composite condition for an object data including a data name and at least a pair of an attribute name and an attribute value is satisfied based on network nodes representing clauses of the composite condition, said network nodes being sequentially processed beginning with a node corresponding to the highest position in the network, comprising the steps of:\ncollecting node processing information when said composite condition is determined to be satisfied; and\ndynamically reconstructing the network basded on the collected node processing information.\n2. A method according to claim 1, wherein said step of dynamically reconstructing the network includes a step of referencing a table which represents favorableness for hierarchic relationships between the nodes.\n3. A method according to claim 1 wherein said node processing information includes information related to a processing volume of each node and information related to a ratio at which a condition described in each node is satisfied.",

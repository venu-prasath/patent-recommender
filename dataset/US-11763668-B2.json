    "abstract": "A method and system of determining whether a stationary vehicle is a blocking vehicle to improve control of an autonomous vehicle. A perception engine may detect a stationary vehicle in an environment of the autonomous vehicle from sensor data received by the autonomous vehicle. Responsive to this detection, the perception engine may determine feature values of the environment of the vehicle from sensor data (e.g., features of the stationary vehicle, other object(s), the environment itself). The autonomous vehicle may input these feature values into a machine-learning model to determine a probability that the stationary vehicle is a blocking vehicle and use the probability to generate a trajectory to control motion of the autonomous vehicle.",

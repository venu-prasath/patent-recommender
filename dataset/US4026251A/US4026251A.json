    "title": "Adaptive control system for power producing machines",
    "abstract": "An adaptive digital electronic control system for an internal combustion engine wherein a given speed modifying parameter is perturbated about a given setting and the resulting effect on the engine's output shaft speed is computed for producing an electrical control signal for adjusting the setting in a way which tends to maximize the shaft output power. Described are arrangements whereby the electronic control system can be applied to a spark ignition system, the air/fuel control of a standard carburetor or the air/fuel control of a fuel injection system.",

    "claims": "\n1. In a control system of a plant, a computer control system utilizing knowledge processing comprising:\nfirst and second storage means for storing a plurality of mathematical models representing a control strategy and usage conditions for the mathematical models, respectively;\nprogram generating means, responsive each time a mathematical model is stored in said first storage means, for generating an executable program of the mathematical model and for converting said executable program to an intermediate code program;\nthird storage means connected to said program generation means for storing intermediate code programs provided thereby;\ncomparing means for sequentially comparing status data and control specification data of a plant to be controlled as supplied from a control unit with the usage conditions of the mathematical models stored in said second storage means;\nmeans responsive to said comparing means finding correspondence between said supplied status and specification data and a stored usage condition for selecting the mathematical model for that usage condition from said first storage means;\ninterpreter means responsive to selection of a mathematical model by said selecting means for executing the intermediate code program corresponding to the selected mathematical model to produce a calculated result; and\nmeans for controlling the plant in accordance with the calculated result given by said interpreter means.\n2. A computer controlling system utilizing knowledge processing according to claim 1, wherein said plurality of mathematical models and said usage conditions therefor comprise cost functions and restriction conditions for the plant under control.\n3. A computer control system utilizing knowledge base according to claim 1, wherein each mathematical model is related with a mathematical model name, and a usage condition for each mathematical model comprises a presumption portion representing a condition for the use of the mathematical model and a conclusion portion including the corresponding mathematical formula model name.",

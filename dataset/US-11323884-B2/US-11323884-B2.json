    "abstract": "Detecting, mitigating and isolating a Signaling Storm, particularly in 5G communication networks. A Control Plane signal probe is connected at a first network node located between a Radio Access Network and a 5G Core Network, to monitor control messages originating from 5G-capable devices. A User Plane signal probe is connected at a second network node located between the 5G Core Network and remote entities to which the 5G-capable devices are sending messages, to monitor control messages passing through the second network node. An Inventory Management sub-system stores data correlating between 5G-capable devices and IMSI numbers. A Protector Unit is configured to receive (i) data collected by the Control Plane signal probe, and (ii) data collected by the User Plane signal probe, and (iii) a subset of IMSI numbers. The Protector Unit performs Machine Learning analysis, and detects and quarantines particular 5G-capable devices that are compromised or malfunctioning.",

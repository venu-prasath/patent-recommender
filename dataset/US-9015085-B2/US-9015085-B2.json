    "abstract": "To entities that are likely to engage in a behavior, a behavior discrimination threshold for each of a plurality of behavior variables is determined. Variable values for each entity of a plurality of target entities and for each of the behavior variables are compared to the relevant behavior discrimination threshold to provide identifying variables for each entity. An index value is determined for each of the plurality of target entities based on the identifying variables for that entity. An index threshold is determined such that those entities of the target entities having index values that meet or exceed the index threshold are likely to exhibit or engage in the behavior more frequently than a random sampling of the plurality of training entities. Actions designed to affect the likelihood that the resulting targeted entities will engage in the behavior may be directed to the targeted entities.",

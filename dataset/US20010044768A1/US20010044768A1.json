    "title": "E-commerce bid and project management system and method for the construction industry",
    "abstract": "An integrated electronic commerce (e-commerce) based construction industry bidding and project management system and methods, including document distribution, supply chain automation and on-line auctioning. In a pre-construction setting, the e-commerce based bidding and project management system and method provides for a user the means for participating and competing in the bidding and construction project management tasks using on-line computerized telecommunications technologies. The on-line system and methodologies help the participants to achieve cost efficiencies and performance enhancements that traditional prior art manual bidding and construction management systems and methods have not achieved. In a global system setting the present invention facilitates management of real estate, development, building and construction industries, including architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) project phases, including design, specification, research, bidding, financing, procurement, construction, and maintenance.",

    "title": "Audio subsystem for computer-based conferencing system",
    "abstract": "An audio task residing on an audio/communications board of an audio subsystem in a computer conferencing system. An audio manager and an audio applications programming interface reside on a host processor of the computer conferencing system. The audio task receives local analog audio signals, generates local compressed audio signals corresponding to the local analog audio signals, and passes the local compressed audio signals to a communications subsystem of the computer conferencing system for transmission over a communications link to a remote computer conferencing system. The audio task receives remote compressed audio signals from the communications subsystem and generates remote decompressed audio signals corresponding to the remote compressed audio signal for local playback.",

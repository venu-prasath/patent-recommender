    "abstract": "Systems and methods for providing assistance to a surgeon during an implant surgery are disclosed. A method includes defining areas of interest in diagnostic data of a patient and defining a screw bone type based on the surgeon's input. Post defining the areas of interest, salient points are determined for the areas of interest. Successively, an XZ angle, an XY angle, and a position entry point for a screw are determined based on the salient points of the areas of interest. Successively, a maximum screw diameter and a length of the screw are determined based on the salient points. Thereafter, the screw is identified and suggested to the surgeon for usage during the implant surgery.",

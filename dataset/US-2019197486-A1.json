    "abstract": "Techniques for calculating probability of hire scores in a streaming environment are described. In an embodiment, a system accesses a candidate stream definition comprising a hiring organization and a role. Additionally, the system accesses, based on the candidate stream definition, one or more stream-related information sources, and extracts attributes from the stream-related information sources. Moreover, the system identifies similar organizations based on the attributes, the role, and features of the hiring organization. Then, the system accesses historical data regarding hiring patterns at the similar organizations for the role. The system calculates, based on the historical data and interactions by the hiring organization with member profiles of an online system (e.g., hosting a social networking service), a probability of hire for the role. Next, the system presents the probability of hire. In some embodiments, the system identifies the similar organizations by identifying related roles based on the attributes and the role.",

The computer system of claim 2, wherein the calculating is based on comparing the historical data with a number of the one or more member profiles reviewed and a number of messages sent to members of the online system by the hiring organization.\n4. The computer system of claim 1, the operations further comprising:\ncausing presentation, on the display device, of a prompt to display insights regarding actions that the hiring organization can take to increase the probability of hire.\n5. The computer system of claim 4, the operations further comprising:\nresponsive to receiving a response to the prompt, causing presentation, on the display device, of the actions.\n6. The computer system of claim 5, wherein the actions include one or more of:\na number of member profiles of members of the online system to be reviewed; and\na number of messages to be sent by the hiring organization to members of the online system.\n7. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the probability of hire is a percentage chance of filling the role in a certain time frame.\n8. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the certain time frame is 30 days.\n9. The computer system of claim 1, wherein:\nthe online system hosts a social networking service; and\nthe one or more member profiles are member profiles in the social networking service corresponding to candidates for the role.\n10. The computer system of claim 1, wherein:\nthe features of the hiring organization include one or more of: an industry, organization size, and geographic locations where the hiring organization has employees; and\nidentifying the one or more similar organizations comprises comparing the features of the hiring organization to features of the one or more similar organizations.\n11.

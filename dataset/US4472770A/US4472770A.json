    "title": "Self-optimizing method and machine",
    "abstract": "The invention discloses method for self-optimizing, dynamically and in real time, a machine relative to a specific performance characteristic in response to variations on a prescribed number m of variables. This method comprises statistically designing a matrix of operating conditions of the machine; sequentially operating the machine according to the designed matrix of operating conditions; testing the performance characteristic of the thus-operated machine; analyzing the tested performance characteristic against a given optimizing criterion; and feeding back for or returning to the designing step for a new, improved operating condition. A machine in the form of programmed microprocessor embodying this self-optimizing method is also disclosed.",

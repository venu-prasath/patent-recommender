    "abstract": "Computer systems and methods generate data examples by training, through machine learning, a data generator with a training objective to produce a data example for a specific value of R, where R is value related to S1(x) and S2(x), where, for a data example, x, generated by the data generator, S1(x) is a likelihood that the data example x is in a first class of a first selected data example and S2(x) is a likelihood that the data example x is in a second class of a second selected data example. S1(x) and S2(x) are determined by a discriminator that is trained through machine learning to discriminate between the first and second classes. After training the data generator, the data generator generates a synthetic data example for each of multiple specific values of R.",

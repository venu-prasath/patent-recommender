    "abstract": "A system and method configures permission settings for applications (\u201capps\u201d) running on a computing device of a user. A data center generates at least one model of collective privacy preferences. The computing device is in communication with the data center via a communications network. The computing device comprises a processor that execute at least a first app that requests access to at least one permission of the computing device and a personal privacy assistant app. The personal privacy assistant app receives the at least one model from the one or more servers of the data center; collects information about the user; identifies at least one recommended permission setting for the first app based on the at least one model and such that the recommended permission setting is user-specific; and configures the computing device to implement the received at least one user-specific recommended permission setting.",

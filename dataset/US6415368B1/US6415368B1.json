    "title": "System and method for caching",
    "abstract": "A system and method of caching uses quality or value attributes, provided for example, by a recommender system or by a dynamical analysis of site accesses, which are attached to cached information to prioritize items in the cache. Documents are prioritized in the cache according to the relative value of their content. Value data may be provided from a recommender system which provides a value for a document according to user recommendations (using explicit recommendations) or from statistical analysis of site visits from unique users (implicit recommendations) or a combination of the two to identify the higher value documents. The caching method may also be used to improve performance of a recommender system.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for determining which items to store in a cache, comprising:\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein recommendation data is a function of the quality and the quantity of recommendations from users of the item.\n3. The method of claim 1 wherein the value data further includes recency and frequency of web site access data.\n4. The method of claim 1 further comprising, for each item stored in the cache, validating the item's value data and reprioritizing the items stored based on the validated value data.\n5. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\n6. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\n7. The method of claim 1, wherein the prioritizing step comprises evaluating w(ti), the weighting metric,\nw\n\ue8a0\n(\nt\ni\n)\n=\n1\nMTNR\ni\n,\nwhere\n\ue89e\n\ue89e\nMTNR\ni\n=\n\u03b1\n\u2032\n\ue89e\nt\ni\n+\n(\n1\n-\n\u03b1\n\u2032\n)\n\ue89e\nMTNR\ni\n-\n1\n\ue89e\n\ue89e\nand\n\u03b1\n\u2032\n=\n\u03b1\nf\n\ue8a0\n(\nv\ni\n)\n,\nMTNR\ni\n8. The method of claim 1, wherein the items comprise web pages and wherein the value data comprises a weighted combination of statistical information pertaining to the number of unique users visiting a web site associated with the web pages and recommendation data from a recommender system which provides a value for an item according to user recommendations of the web page.\n9. A system for caching items on a distributed network, comprising:\n10. The system of claim 9, wherein the recommender system provides recommendation data as a function of the quality and the quantity of recommendations from users of the item.\n11. The system of claim 9 wherein the value module further provides value data including recency and frequency of web site access data.\n12. The system of claim 9 wherein the processor, for each item stored in the cache, validates the item's value data and reprioritizes the items stored based on the validated value data.\n13. The system of claim 9, wherein the processor further obtains recency of use data for each item; and priorities the items to be stored in the cache in accordance with the relative value of each item and each item's recency of use data.\n14. The system of claim 9, wherein the processor further obtains recency and frequency of use data for each item and prioritizes the items to be stored in the cache in accordance with the relative value of each item and each item's recency and frequency of use.\n15. The system of claim 9, wherein the processor priorities the items in accordance with an evaluation of w(ti), the weighting metric:\nw\n\ue8a0\n(\nt\ni\n)\n=\n1\nMTNR\ni\n,\nwhere\n\ue89e\n\ue89e\nMTNR\ni\n=\n\u03b1\n\u2032\n\ue89e\nt\ni\n+\n(\n1\n-\n\u03b1\n\u2032\n)\n\ue89e\nMTNR\ni\n-\n1\n\ue89e\n\ue89e\nand\n\u03b1\n\u2032\n=\n\u03b1\nf\n\ue8a0\n(\nv\ni\n)\n,\nMTNR\ni\n16. The system of claim 9, wherein the value data comprises positive, negative and zero values and wherein an item receives a value data of zero if no value data is available for it.\n17. The system of claim 9, wherein the computer comprises a network proxy server.\n18. The system of claim 9, wherein the computer comprises a recommender system.",

    "abstract": "Embodiments of systems presented herein may perform automatic granular difficulty adjustment. In some embodiments, the difficulty adjustment is undetectable by a user. Further, embodiments of systems disclosed herein can review historical user activity data with respect to one or more video games to generate a game retention prediction model that predicts an indication of an expected duration of game play. The game retention prediction model may be applied to a user's activity data to determine an indication of the user's expected duration of game play. Based on the determined expected duration of game play, the difficulty level of the video game may be automatically adjusted.",
    "claims": "\n1. A computer-implemented method comprising:\nas implemented by an interactive computing system configured with specific computer-executable instructions,\naccessing user interaction data of a user, wherein the user interaction data is associated with interaction by the user with a video game;\naccessing a plurality of cluster definitions associated with a plurality of clusters, wherein each cluster definition of the plurality of cluster definitions is associated with a different cluster of the plurality of clusters, and wherein each cluster of the plurality of clusters comprises an identity of one or more users who share one or more engagement characteristics associated with interaction with the video game;\nselecting a target cluster from the plurality of clusters based at least in part on the user interaction data of the user and the plurality of cluster definitions;\nidentifying a configuration value for a state variable of the video game based at least in part on the target cluster; and\nconfiguring the state variable using the configuration value, wherein configuring the state variable adjusts a difficulty of the video game.\n2.

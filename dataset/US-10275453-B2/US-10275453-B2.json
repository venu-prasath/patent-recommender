    "abstract": "A method is disclosed for identifying paraphrases in a natural language processing (NLP) system comprising: receiving a first phrase and a second phrase by a system; analyzing the first phrase and the second phrase to provide a semantic and structural hierarchical comparison assessment, the semantic and structural hierarchical comparison assessment having an associated semantic and structural hierarchical comparison assessment value; and determining whether the semantic and structural hierarchical comparison assessment value exceeds a predetermined paraphrase equivalency criteria; and, responsive to determining the semantic and structural hierarchical comparison assessment value exceeds the predetermined paraphrase equivalency criteria, classifying the second phrase as being a rewording of the first phrase.",
    "claims": "\n1. A computer-implementable method for identifying paraphrases in a natural language processing (NLP) system comprising:\nreceiving a first phrase and a second phrase by a system;\nanalyzing the first phrase and the second phrase to provide a semantic and structural hierarchical comparison assessment, the semantic and structural hierarchical comparison assessment having an associated semantic and structural hierarchical comparison assessment value; and\ndetermining whether the semantic and structural hierarchical comparison assessment value exceeds a predetermined paraphrase equivalency criteria;\nresponsive to determining the semantic and structural hierarchical comparison assessment value exceeds the predetermined paraphrase equivalency criteria, classifying the second phrase as being a rewording of the first phrase.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein:\nthe structural hierarchical comparison assessment includes a vector based and a semantic based framework.\n3. The method of claim 2, wherein:\nthe first phrase and the second phrase are in a single language.\n4. The method of claim 3, further comprising:\nutilizing the first phrase and the second phrase in a ground truth classifier for a system capable of answering questions.\n5. The method of claim 1, wherein:\nthe semantic and structural hierarchical comparison assessment comprises performing an ensemble operation on the first phrase and the second phrase, the ensemble operation providing a structural similarity score.\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein:\nthe semantic and structural hierarchical comparison assessment comprises performing a semantic similarity operation, the semantic similarity operation providing a semantic similarity score.",

    "abstract": "The present invention includes a system and method for testing and monitoring an application (1i h). The application (1i h) includes and is operable to execute at least one test case operable to test at least one aspect of the application. The present invention includes a registrar within the test coordinator (1i c) for registering test cases associated with the application (1i h); a test user interface (1i b) for generating requests to initiate execution of the registered test cases; the test coordinator (1i c) also includes a mechanism for controlling the execution of the test cases in accordance with a set of policy parameters and for periodically providing status information during the execution of the test cases; and test history and reporting (1i d) responsive to the test user interface (1i b) and the test coordinator (1i c) for evaluating execution of the application (1i h) in accordance with the set of policy parameters.",

    "claims": "\n1. A computer system for post deployment testing, dynamic monitoring and diagnosis of an on-line application, said on-line application including and operable to execute at least one built-in test case built into said application, said built-in test case operable to test at least one aspect of said on-line application, the system comprising:\na test coordinator responsive to said on-line application for storing registration information describing said at least one built-in test case to a test case definition storage;\na test user interface responsive to a user for presenting said at least one built-in test case to said user in accordance with the registration information and for accepting a request to initiate execution of said at least one built-in test case;\nsaid test coordinator responsive to said request for initiating and controlling said execution of said at least one built-in test case in accordance with a set of policy variables and for periodically providing status information to said test user interface during said execution of said at least one built-in test case;\nsaid test user interface further operable to present said status information to said user during said execution of said at least one built-in test case; and\ntest history reporting responsive to said test user interface and said test coordinator for evaluating execution results of said at least one built-in test case in accordance with said set of policy parameters, thereby generating evaluation results.\n2. The system of claim 1 wherein said test history reporting responsive to said test user interface and said test coordinator, is further operable to evaluate and diagnose anomalies detected from said at least one aspect of said on-line application by comparing said execution results of said at least one built-in test case to at least one reference test case in accordance with said set of policy parameters.\n3. The computer system of claim 1 wherein said test history reporting is further operable to generate reports including said evaluation results and said execution results.\n4. The system of claim 1 wherein test case definition includes:\na pre-test for setting up an operating environment in preparation for said execution of said at least one test case;\na test for testing said at least one aspect of the on-line application;\na post-test for resetting the operating environment after said execution of said at least one test case; and\na test mode for classifying said at least one built-in test case in terms of its effect on other production activities in the operating environment.\n5. The computer system of claim 1 wherein said test user interface includes means within said on-line application for initiating execution of said at least one built-in test case.\n6. The computer system of claim 1 wherein said test history reporting is further operable to store said execution results of said at least one built-in test case as another reference test case.\n7. A computer system for post deployment testing, monitoring and diagnosis of an on-line application, said on-line application including and operable to execute at least one built-in test case built into said on-line application, said built-in test case operable to test at least one aspect of said on-line application, the system comprising:\na test coordinator responsive to said on-line application for storing registration information describing said at least one built-in test case to a test case definition storage;\na test user interface responsive to a user for presenting said at least one built-in test case to said user in accordance with the registration information and for accepting a request to initiate execution of said at least one built-in test case;\nsaid test coordinator responsive to said request for initiating and controlling said execution of said at least one test case in accordance with a set of policy parameters and for periodically providing status information to said test user interface during said execution of said at least one built-in test case;\nsaid test user interface further operable to present said status information to said user during said execution of said at least one built-in test case;\ntest history reporting responsive to said test user interface and said test coordinator for evaluating execution results of said at least one built-in test case in accordance with said set of policy parameters, thereby generating evaluation results; and\nsaid test user interface further including means for presenting said execution results and said evaluation results to said user.\n8. A computer system for post deployment testing, monitoring and diagnosis of an on-line application, said application including and operable to execute at least one built-in test case built into said on-line application, said built-in test case operable to test at least one aspect of said on-line application, the system comprising:\na test coordinator responsive to said on-line application for storing registration information registering said at least one built-in test case;\na test user interface for generating a first request to initiate execution of said at least one built-in test case;\nsaid test coordinator responsive to said test user interface for initiating and controlling said execution of said at least one built-in test case in accordance with a set of policy parameters and for periodically providing status information to said test user interface during said execution of said at least one built-in test case;\nsaid test user interface further responsive to said status information for displaying said status information during said execution of said at least one built-in test case;\ntest history reporting responsive to said test user interface and said test coordinator for evaluating execution results of said at least one built-in test case in accordance with said set of policy parameters, thereby generating evaluation results; and\nsaid test coordinator further responsive to said test history reporting for initiating and controlling execution of at least one diagnostic test case in response to said evaluation results.",

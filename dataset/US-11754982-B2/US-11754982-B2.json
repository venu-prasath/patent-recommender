    "abstract": "A computerized method of assigning a building automation system point type to a plurality of unclassified data points is provided. The method includes receiving unclassified data points and attributes for each data point. The method includes receiving classifications for a first subset of the unclassified data points. Each classification associates a data point with a building automation system point type. The method includes generating a term set containing substrings that appear in the attributes. The method includes generating a first matrix describing a frequency that the substrings appear in the attributes. The method includes calculating an indicator of a probability that the presence of the selected substring results in the data point belonging to the selected point type. The method includes assigning a point type to a second subset by finding the substring and potential point type pair having the greatest indication of probability.",
    "claims": "\n1.

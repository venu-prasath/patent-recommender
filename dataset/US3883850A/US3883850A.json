    "title": "Programmable word recognition apparatus",
    "abstract": "An apparatus which receives coded input data representative of speech feature sequences associated with selected words as spoken by an individual. The coded data is typically formulated beforehand from speech samples of the individual and is entered when the individual is to operate the apparatus. The apparatus is ''''programmed'''' by the coded input data to recognize the selected words when they are subsequently spoken by the individual. In accordance with the invention there is provided a feature extraction means for processing received spoken words and generating feature output signals on particular ones of a number of feature output lines. At least one sequential logic chain is provided, the chain including a plurality of logic units having logic input lines. The logic units are sequentially activated by the presence of signals on the logic input lines. Programmable means are provided for effectively coupling selected ones of the feature output lines to the logic input lines, the coupling selections depending on the coded input data. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the programmable means includes means for periodically sampling selected output signals and applying the sampled signals to the logic input lines, the feature output signal sampled at a given time being determined by the coded input data. In this embodiment, the sampled signals are applied to the logic input lines in a predetermined sequence, the predetermined sequence being repeated continuously.",

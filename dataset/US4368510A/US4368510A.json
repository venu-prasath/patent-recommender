    "claims": "\n1. In a method for tuning a continuously tunable controller in which the controller parameters are responsive to at least one of a plurality of signal inputs so that said controller sends signals to control a process and supplies an input signal to a model of said process in which said model has parameters which are variable in accordance with the difference between the value of a signal that corresponds to the state of the process and the value of the output signal from process model, wherein signals that correspond to said model parameters are applied to the controller, and the said model parameters are identified by making step changes in the set point of the controller and permitting the process to reach a predetermined portion of the value of said step changes in the set point, the improvement comprising,\nproviding a first signal which corresponds to the state of said process at a given time; providing a second signal which corresponds to said set point change; providing means for creating a cycle which includes the steps of adding, ignoring and subtracting said second signal from said first signal during time intervals and applying the resulting signal to said controller whereby said controller varies the input signal to the model of said process; determining the value of the output signal from said process model; and repeating said cycle until the change in the value of said output signal corresponding to at least one of said model parameters from said process model from the previous cycle to the present cycle is less than a predetermined value so that said model parameters are identified automatically.\n2. The method as defined in claim 1 including the step of providing a third signal which corresponds to the sum of said first signal and said predetermined portion of said second signal; providing a fourth signal which corresponds to the state of said process a time subsequent to said given time, detecting the length of the interval that said third signal takes to become substantially equal to said fourth signal; adding said first signal to said second signal for said interval, not applying said first signal to said signal for said interval; subtracting said first signal from said second signal for said interval and not applying said first signal to said second signal for said interval.\n3. The method as defined in claim 1 wherein said predetermined value is about one percent.\n4. The method as defined in claim 1 wherein said change in the value of said output signal is determined by comparing the signal that corresponds to the square of the change of the value of said output signal from said given time to a subsequent time divided by a signal that corresponds to the square of said output signal at said given time.\n5. The method as defined in claim 1 wherein there are a plurality of output signals and the value of each of said output signals corresponds to the value of one of said model parameters, and said change in the value of each of said model parameters is determined by comparing a signal that corresponds to the sum of the squares of the change in the value of said model parameters from said given time to a subsequent time divided by the sum of the squares of the values of said parameters at said given time.\n6. In an apparatus for tuning a continuously tunable controller which controller is responsive to at least one of a plurality of signal inputs so that said controller controls a process, said apparatus including a model of said process which model has parameters which are variable in accordance with the difference between a signal that corresponds to the state of the process and an output signal from the process model and in which signals that correspond to the values of said model parameters are applied to the controller, and wherein said model parameters are identified by making step changes in the set point of the controller and permitting the process to reach a predetermined proportion of the value of said changes, the improvement comprising,\nmeans for providing a first signal which corresponds to the state of said process at a given time, means for providing a second signal which corresponds to said set point change, means for creating a cycle comprising a plurality of steps, said steps including determining the time interval for said process to reach said predetermined portion of said changes, adding, ignoring, and subtracting said second signal from said first signal during time intervals equal to said determined time interval so that the signal resulting therefrom is applied to said controller to control said process whereby the value of said model parameters change, means for repeating said cycle until the values of said model parameters change from the previous cycle less than a predetermined amount when compared to the next adjacent cycle.\n7. An apparatus as defined in claim 6 including means for comparing signals, means for adding the value of said first signal to a predetermined proportion of the value of said second signal to create a third signal, means for applying said third signal to said comparing means, means for applying a fourth signal to said comparing means wherein said fourth signal corresponds to the state of said process prior to said given time, means for measuring the time interval for said fourth signal to equal said third signal, and means for remembering the length of said time interval.\n8. An apparatus as defined in claim 7 wherein the output signal from said comparing means comprises a first gating signal, means for providing a second gating signal, said first and second gating signals cooperating to advance said cycle creating means from said referencing step to its next step.\n9. An apparatus as defined in claim 7 including means for multiplying said second signal by a factor to get a predetermined value of said second signal, means for adding said predetermined value of said second signal to said first signal whereby said third signal is generated.\n10. An apparatus as defined in claim 6 including a decoder and a multiplier, and said means for creating said cycle and said multiplier are operative to multiply the value of said second signal by at least (+1), (0), (-1) and (0) respectively during said steps of said cycle so that when said second signal is summed with said first signal it is respectively, added, ignored, subtracted and ignored from said first signal.\n11. An apparatus as defined in claim 6 wherein said means for repeating said cycle comprises means for comparing the value of a signal that corresponds to the proportional change of the value of the output signal from said model parameter identifier from a prior time to said given time with the value of a reference signal, and means for enabling said cycle creating means when said proportional change of the value of said output signal is more than the value of said reference signal.\n12. An apparatus as defined in claim 8 where said means for repeating said cycle further comprises means for squaring the differences of signals corresponding to the values of said output signals from said model parameter identifiers of the preceeding cycle with the present cycle to get a first group of squared signals, means for squaring the values of said last named signals for said preceeding cycle to get a second group of squared signals, means for summing each of signals in each of said groups of squared signals, means for dividing the sum of said first group of signals by the sum of said second group of signals to provide said proportional change signal, so that said signal that corresponds to the proportional change of the value of the output signal from said model parameter identifier from a previous time to said given time is obtained.",

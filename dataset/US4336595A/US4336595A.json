    "title": "Structural life computer",
    "abstract": "This is an electronic device which determines the fatigue life of a structure and its crack growth characteristics when subjected to repeated loading by using the signal from an electrical resistance type strain gage secured to the structure to provide the input to a processor which monitors cyclic excursions, calculates the fatigue and fracture structural damage from those excursions, stores the cumulative damage, and displays that damage on command.",

    "claims": "\n1. A structural life computer to receive electrical signals from a sensor located on a structure under cyclic loads which signals have been converted to digital signals corresponding to maximum and minimum values of stress changes in said structure, and to calculate the structural damage to said structure as indicated by said stress changes, said computer comprising:\na processor operatively connected to said sensor to receive said digital signals:\na cycle determinant operatively connected to said processor to separate said digital signals into discrete peak values corresponding to each stress change and return said peak values to said processor;\na damage calculator operatively connected to said processor to receive said peak values and compute the analytical structure damage value by comparing said discrete peak values with pre-established peak values determined experimentally and return said structural damage value to said processor;\na damage storage operatively connected to said damage calculator and to said processor to receive and accumulate the damage value computed as aforesaid and return said accumulated damage value to said processor; and\na display operatively connected to said processor to indicate said accumulated damage value.\n2. The computer of claim 1 including a temporary storage digital register operatively connected between said sensor and said processor to receive and retain said digital signals in excess of those capable of being received and fed by said processor selectively to said cycle determinant, said calculator, said storage and said display.\n3. The computer of claim 2 wherein said temporary storage digital register is a first-in-first-out unit.\n4. The computer of claim 1 including a mean-versus-variable storage register connected to said processor.\n5. The computer of claim 1 wherein said cycle determinant includes a preprogrammed algorithm.\n6. The computer of claim 5 wherein said preprogrammed algorithm includes rainflow counting to count half cycles.\n7. The computer of claim 6 wherein said damage calculator includes means to compute the mean and variable stress values of each said half cycle and said computer includes a storage for said mean and variable stress values and a display operatively connected to said processor to indicate said mean and variable stress values.\n8. The computer of claim 4 wherein said preprogrammed algorithm includes a rainflow cycle counting method to determine the cycles and half cycles to be held and sorted by said cycle determinant.\n9. The combination of claim 1 wherein said structure is an aircraft and said sensor is an electrical resistance type strain gage secured to a preselected area of said aircraft and operative to generate a signal corresponding to each change in load imposed thereon, said strain gage being electrically connected to a signal conditioner amplifier to receive the signals generated by said strain gage and convert them into signals corresponding to a change in stress in said preselected aircraft area and an analog-to-digital converter to change the signals converted by said signal conditioner and amplifier to said digital signals.",

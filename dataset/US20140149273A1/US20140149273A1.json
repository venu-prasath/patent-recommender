    "title": "Market Microstructure Data Method and Appliance",
    "abstract": "A system and apparatus generates trading algorithms as data feeds. These data feeds are derived from market data feeds from electronic trading platforms. Functions of invention include the generation of the feeds as market microstructure analytics, trading algorithm building blocks, market behavior and risk estimates that are synchronized with underlying market data feeds. The invention incorporates utilities for agent-driven simulation of multiple electronic markets, and real-time testing and calibration of trading strategies. By delivering critical market dynamics that have not been available so far to market participants, the invention is projected to cut the cost of designing, implementing, and validating trading strategies while also increasing trading performance significantly. The invention will have an equalizing effect on trading by enabling retail investors to remain competitive with high speed traders. This equalizing effect will complement many trading platforms' initiatives for attracting retail flow to enhance their trading volumes and liquidity quality.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method, the method comprising:\nconstructing probability distributions of time series numerically over intervals from the statistical properties of these time series;\nstoring these time series in sequential time windows each with different time horizons and time scales;\nrepresenting market signals, and market microstructure data feeds, including market estimates, risk measures, trading algorithms, tradability metrics consistently via numerical functional reconstruction;\nderiving data feeds for market microstructure information, market estimates, risk measures, trading algorithms, tradability metrics from market data feeds using numerical functional reconstruction over multiple time intervals;\ndelivering these derived feeds to traders as algorithm feeds that can be integrated in real time by users' trading systems;\nsynchronizing and integrating market data feeds with these derived feeds in ticker plants, reducing substantially traders' needs to deploy separate analytics and complex event processing apparatus over their data series;\nintegrating numerical functional reconstruction with inductive reasoning techniques to provide a consistent mathematical and heuristic agent-based tool for market simulation;\naugmenting inductive reasoning techniques with predictive and corrective methods to iteratively train trading agents to operate as different types of market participants, including market maker, market taker, high frequency trader, scalper, institutional trader, in market simulations; and\n2. The method of claim 1 wherein said numerical constructions of distribution functions can be deployed over dynamic time horizons whereby the numerical constructions are validated for stationarity and, strengths of statistical measures according to validation tests and threshold metrics that use numerical measures of moments, modes, means, dispersions of underlying data;\nwherein these validation tests are conducted over time series of statistics of the underlying series, thereby providing a consistent baseline for numerically characterized stochastic processes; and\nwherein the metrics of these tests are interchangeable with metrics with different formulas that provide the same functionality, such as, for example, the replacement of Pearson correlation test with polynomial or nonlinear correlation or cointegration tests.\n3. The method of claim 1 wherein said deployment of data and numerically constructed functions over time horizons can be executed by using numerous time scaling methods, including logarithmic and other nonlinear methods, whereby metrics such as volatility over such horizons will be consistent over horizons that cover multiple time scales;\nwherein these metrics will be updated sequentially as underlying market data or derived numerically constructed functions that will be shifted across these multiple time horizons in real time;\nwherein the time windowing method will provide a consistent and synchronized set of metrics, including and not limited to mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, autocorrelation, correlation for market data and market microstructure data, whereby such consistency and synchronization are crucial for effective real-time integration of these feeds in trading systems; and\nwherein the underlying market data and market microstructure data feeds can be selectively delivered to users according to their time frequencies of interests and their latency profiles for accessing markets.\n4. The method of claim 1 wherein the trading agents of the market simulator are implemented as feedback control systems whereby:\nagents' simulation of different types of market participants are determined consistently by relative margins on risk metrics and market estimates, and agents' ensuing use of statistical libraries to generate stochastic processes that are uniquely and numerically characterized according to these margin values;\nthereby enabling automated switching of market participants' roles during market simulation, enabling market simulation and emulations with dynamically evolving roles for real or simulated market participants; and\nwherein simulated markets' and agents' behaviors are fully backward traceable due to consistent use of numerical functional reconstruction across the whole appliance.\n5. The method of claim 1 whereby the calibration of users' trading strategies are consistently checked against market data and market microstructure data feeds that are numerically constructed without any assumptions about markets' behavior and without any analytically closed form models, thereby providing a consistent benchmark for trading algorithm calibration across wide trading frequency and market regimes, and for diverse trading strategies.\n6. The method of claim 1 whereby the Market Microstructure Data Appliance is deployed as a publish and subscribe system by using the Data Distribution Service protocol that is scalable and reconfigurable in terms of bandwidth and throughout at any connection point or across any process within the appliance, thereby enabling the mapping on the components of the appliance on centric or distributed architectures and as functions implemented in software and hardware, while maintaining the coherence of its operating logic.",

    "abstract": "In one embodiment, a method includes accessing a set of training objects associated with an object-classification, identifying, from comments associated with the training objects, by an initial object-classifier algorithm configured to classify objects as associated with an object-classification by comparing comments associated with each object to one or more features, a first set of features, each feature having a corresponding text expression and a feature score indicating a correlation value between the feature and the object-classification, adding the first set of features to the algorithm to generate a revised object-classifier algorithm, accessing a set of test objects, classifying one or more of the test objects as associated with the object-classification, identifying, from comments associated with the classified test objects, a second set of features having feature scores greater than a threshold feature score, and adding the second set of features to the revised algorithm to generate a final object-classifier algorithm.",
    "claims": "\n1.

The method of claim 1, further comprising:\naccessing a social graph comprising a plurality of nodes and a plurality of edges connecting the nodes, wherein each edge between two nodes represents a single degree of separation between the two nodes, the plurality of nodes comprising:\na plurality of nodes corresponding to a plurality of users of the online social network, respectively, wherein a degree of separation between any two user nodes is a minimum number of edges required to traverse the social graph data from one user node to the other; and\na plurality of nodes corresponding to the plurality of objects posted to the online social network, respectively.\n3. The method of claim 2, wherein each of the plurality of objects is a post by a first user of the online social network corresponding to a first user node and each comment associated with the object is a comment on the post by a second user of the online social network corresponding to a second user node.\n4. The method of claim 3, wherein, for each of the plurality of objects, each second user node is within a single degree of separation from the first user node in the social graph.\n5. The method of claim 3, wherein classifying the one or more test objects as associated with the first object-classification is based at least in part on, for each test object, an affinity coefficient between the first user and one or more of the second users.\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein one or more of the plurality of objects are associated with one or more posts on a third-party website, respectively.\n7. The method of claim 6, wherein, for each object associated with a post on a third-party website, the comments associated with the object are implemented using a social plug-in associated with the online social network.\n8. The method of claim 1, wherein classifying the one or more test objects as associated with the first object-classification comprises scoring each test object by comparing the comments associated with the test object to the first set of features.\n9. The method of claim 8, wherein scoring each test object further comprises scoring each comment associated with the test object.\n10. The method of claim 9, wherein scoring each test object further comprises calculating a test object score by combining the scores of each comment associated with the test object.\n11. The method of claim 9, wherein scoring each test object further comprises calculating a test object score by averaging the scores of each comment associated with the test object.\n12. The method of claim 1, wherein the feature score of each feature is based at least in part on a frequency of occurrence of the feature in comments associated with one or more objects associated with the first object-classification.\n13. The method of claim 1, wherein classifying the one or more test objects as associated with the first object-classification comprises comparing each test object to a set of filtering criteria.\n14. The method of claim 13, wherein the set of filtering criteria is based on metadata associated with the test objects and comments associated with the test objects.\n15. The method of claim 14, wherein the metadata comprises one or more of:\na number of associated comments;\ninclusion or exclusion of one or more text strings;\ninclusion or exclusion of one or more punctuation marks;\nan association with one or more object-types;\nan association with one or more languages;\nan association with one or more places, entities, or resource-types;\nan association with one or more other objects; or\nan association with a particular period of time.\n16. The method of claim 15, wherein the one or more punctuation marks comprise one or more of a question mark or exclamation mark.\n17. The method of claim 15, wherein the one or more object-types comprise one or more of photos, posts, pages, applications, events, locations, or user groups.\n18. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the final-object classifier algorithm further comprises one or more iterations of a training process, each iteration comprising:\naccessing, from the plurality of objects, a randomly selected set of test objects;\nclassifying, by the final object-classifier algorithm, one or more test objects of the randomly selected set of test objects as associated with the first object-classification;\nidentifying, by the final object-classifier algorithm, from comments associated with the one or more classified test objects of the randomly selected set of test objects, a third set of features having feature scores greater than a threshold feature score; and\nadding, to the final object-classifier algorithm, the third set of features to generate a revised final object-classifier algorithm.\n19.

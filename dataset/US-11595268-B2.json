    "abstract": "In one embodiment, a service that monitors a network detects a plurality of anomalies in the network. The service uses data regarding the detected anomalies as input to one or more machine learning models. The service maps, using a conceptual space, outputs of the one or more machine learning models to symbols. The service applies a symbolic reasoning engine to the symbols, to rank the anomalies. The service sends an alert for a particular one of the detected anomalies to a user interface, based on its corresponding rank.",

    "abstract": "One embodiment of the present invention discloses a process of providing a report predicting potential risks relating to an operator driving a vehicle using information obtained from various interior and exterior sensors, vehicle onboard computer (\u201cVOC\u201d), and cloud network. After activating interior and exterior sensors mounted on a vehicle operated by a driver for obtaining data relating to external surroundings and internal environment, the data is forwarded to VOC for generating a current fingerprint associated with the driver. The current fingerprint represents current driving status in accordance with the collected real-time data. Upon uploading the current fingerprint to the cloud via a communications network, a historical fingerprint which represents historical driving information associated with the driver is retrieved. In one aspect, the process is capable of generating a driving analysis report which predicts potential risks associated with the driver according to the current and historical fingerprints.",

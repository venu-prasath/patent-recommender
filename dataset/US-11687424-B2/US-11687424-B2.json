    "abstract": "Described herein are techniques for automating media agent state management. For example, if a media agent is running poorly, then the media agent can be disabled and an alternate media agent can perform secondary copy job operations in place of the poorly running media agent. To determine whether a media agent is running poorly, a storage manager can determine whether the media agent has an anomalous number of failed jobs, pending jobs, and/or long running jobs and/or can determine whether the amount of resources used by the media agent is high or is increasing constantly, at a constant rate, or at a near constant rate.",

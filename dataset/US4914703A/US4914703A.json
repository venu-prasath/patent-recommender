    "title": "Method for deriving acoustic models for use in speech recognition",
    "abstract": "The invention provides a method of deriving generally improved statistical acoustic model of a first class of speech sounds, given a limited amount of sampling data from that first class. This is done by combining a first statistic calculated from samples of that class of speech sounds with a corresponding second statistic calculated from samples of a second, broader, class of speech sounds. Preferably the second statistic is calculated from many more samples than the first statistic, so it has less sampling error that the first statistic, and preferably the second class is a super-set of the first class, so that the second statistic will provide information about the first class. In one embodiment, the invention combines statistics from the models of a plurality of first classes of speech sounds to reduce the sampling error of such statistics and thus improve the accuracy with which such models can be divided into groups of similar models. The first and second statistics can be measurements of spread, of central tendency, or both. They also can relate to different types of parameters, including spectral parameters and parameters representing the duration of speech sounds.",

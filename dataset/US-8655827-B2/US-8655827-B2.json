    "abstract": "A questionnaire generation process presents a first subset from a set of questions of the questionnaire and receives first answers from a user. The first answers are used to determine whether the first answers are sufficient to give definite values to conditions of first rules, wherein the first rules have conditions for providing output. When the first answers are not sufficient, the conditions of the first rules can be used to identify a second subset of the questions, wherein the second subset of questions has second answers such that a combination of the first and second answers is sufficient to give definite values to the respective conditions of the first rules, and the second subset of questions can be presented to the user.",
    "claims": "\n1. A process for generating a questionnaire, the process comprising:\na computing system presenting to a user a first subset from a set of questions of the questionnaire;\nreceiving by the computing system first answers that the user provides to the first subset of questions;\nevaluating by the computing system of first rules to identify any conditions of the first rules that are needed to determine application of the first rules and that are not given values by the first answers, wherein the first rules have respective conditions for providing respective outputs to the user;\nusing the conditions identified to select a second subset of the questions, wherein the second subset of questions are selected so that a combination of the first answers and answers to the second questions gives values to a set of the conditions that are sufficient to determine application of the first rules; and\npresenting the second subset of questions to the user;\nwherein:\nthe first subset of the questions is presented according to authored structure for the questionnaire; and\nthe second subset of the questions is presented as a result of a completeness module of the computing system correcting an error or incompleteness in the authored structure.\n2. The process of claim 1, wherein presenting the first subset of questions comprises:\nsetting each of the questions of the questionnaire to a first state or a second state, wherein questions having the first state are active for presentation to the user and questions not having the first state are not presented to the user;\nchanging a state of a first of the questions from the first state to a third state in response to receiving an answer to the first question; and\nchanging a second question from the second state to the first state in response to an answer to the first question triggering a second rule that indicates a condition for presentation of the second question to the user.\n3. The process of claim 1, wherein the authored structure comprises a set of second rules, the second rules having respective conditions for presentation of one or more of the questions from the questionnaire.\n4. The process of claim 3, wherein the authored structure further comprises a partition of the question into a plurality of sections and an ordering of the sections, wherein the completeness module uses the ordering of sections in presentation of the second subset of the questions.\n5. A non-transitory computer readable media storing instructions that when executed by the computer system cause the computing system to perform the process of claim 1.\n6. The process of claim 1, further comprising setting values of intermediate variables in the computing system according to the first answers and second rules for setting the values for the intermediate variables; wherein the conditions of the first rules depend on the intermediate variables.\n7. The process of claim 1, further comprising constructing a table linking each question to each of the first rules that have conditions that depend on the question, wherein selecting the second subset of the questions comprises identifying questions linked in the table to the first rules that have conditions not given values by the first answers.\n8. A process for generating a questionnaire, the process comprising:\na computing system presenting to a user a first subset from a set of questions of the questionnaire and receiving first answers that the user provides to the first subset of questions, wherein presenting the first subset of questions comprises:\nsetting each of the questions of the questionnaire to a first state or a second state, wherein questions having the first state are active for presentation to the user and questions not having the first state are not presented to the user;\nchanging a state of a first of the questions from the first state to a third state in response to receiving an answer to the first question; and\nchanging a second question from the second state to the first state in response to an answer to the first question triggering a second rule that indicates a condition for presentation of the second question to the user;\nevaluating by the computing system of the first answers to determine whether the first answers are sufficient to give definite values to respective conditions of first rules, wherein the first rules have respective conditions for providing respective output to the user;\ndisabling each of the first rules that is such that an answer from the user indicates that a condition of the disabled first rule cannot be satisfied;\nidentifying all of the first rules that are linked to a third question in that the conditions of the linked first rules depend on an answer to the third question;\nchanging the third question from the second state to a fourth state in response to all of the linked first rules being disabled, wherein questions in the fourth state are disabled from being presented to the user;\nusing the conditions of the first rules to identify a second subset of the questions, wherein the second subset of questions has second answers such that a combination of the first answers and the second answers is sufficient to give definite values to the respective conditions of the first rules; and\npresenting the second subset of questions to the user.\n9. The process of claim 8, wherein identifying the second set of questions comprises determining that the questions are such that none of the questions are in the first state and one or more of the questions are in the second state, and then changing a question from the second state to the first state.\n10. The process of claim 8, further comprising determining that the question presentation is complete in response to determining that none of the questions are in the first state or second state.\n11. The process of claim 8, further comprising constructing a table linking each question to each of the first rules that have conditions that depend on the question, wherein identifying the first rules that are linked to the third question includes using the table.\n12. An advisor system comprising:\ndata storage storing first rules and an authored structure, wherein each of the first rules identifies an output to be provided in response to a condition of the first rule being satisfied, the conditions of the first rules depending on answers given by a user in response to questions; and\na processor arranged to execute a questionnaire generator and a completeness module, wherein the questionnaire generator presents a first set of questions to a user according to the authored structure, and the completeness module corrects an error or incompleteness in the authored structure by using the first rules to identify a second set of questions that were not presented according to the authored structure and that need to be answered in order to determine values for the conditions of the first rules.\n13. The advisor system of claim 12, wherein the authored structure comprises second rules, wherein each of the second rules identifies one or more questions to be presented in response to a condition of the second rule being satisfied, and the questionnaire generator uses the second rules to identify the questions in the first set.\n14. The advisor system of claim 13, wherein the authored structure comprises a partition of the questions of the questionnaire into an ordered series of sections, and the completeness module presents the second set of questions in an order that depends on the ordered series.\n15. The advisor system of claim 12, wherein the completeness module is to identify any conditions of first rules that are needed to determine application of the first rules and are not given values by the answers to the questions presented according to the authored structure and to select the second set of questions according to the conditions identified.",

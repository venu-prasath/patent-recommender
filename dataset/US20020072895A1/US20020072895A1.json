    "title": "Weighting method for use in information extraction and abstracting, based on the frequency of occurrence of keywords and similarity calculations",
    "abstract": "The primary object of the invention is to extract and display keywords as an information abstract that are significant and effective in describing a topic common to a plurality of units, when a large number of character string data sets divided into prescribed units are given. The invention comprises an input section for accepting an input of character string data divided into prescribed units, with each individual character represented by a character code, and an output section for displaying the result of information abstracting. Keywords contained in each of the prescribed units are extracted by a keyword extracting section from the character string data input from the input section, a score is calculated for each keyword by a score calculating section so that a higher score is given to a keyword extracted from a lager number of units, and on the basis of the thus calculated scores, keywords are selected by an abstracting section and are output as an information abstract to the output section.",

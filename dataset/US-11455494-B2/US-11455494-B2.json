    "abstract": "Improved systems and methods for generating training data for classification models are disclosed. In an example, a training application accesses two fragments of text. The application represents each fragment of text as a parse thicket. The parse thickets jointly represent syntactic and discourse information. From the parse thickets, the application generalizes the text by identifying common entities or common rhetorical relations between parse thickets. The generalized text is added to a training data set, thereby increasing the coverage of the training set.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method for extending a training data set for a classification model, the method comprising:\nconstructing, for a first body of text comprising fragments, a first syntactic tree and a first discourse tree;\nconstructing, for a second body of text comprising fragments, a second syntactic tree and a second discourse tree, each discourse tree comprising terminal nodes and nonterminal nodes, wherein each terminal node is associated with one of the fragments of the respective body of text and each nonterminal node represents a rhetorical relationship between two of the fragments;\nmerging the first syntactic tree and the first discourse tree into a first parse thicket;\nmerging the second syntactic tree and the second discourse tree into a second parse thicket, wherein each parse thicket identifies one or more of the following: (i) two nouns in a different fragment represented by the respective syntactic trees, wherein each noun represents a common entity, or (ii) an additional rhetorical relation between fragments represented by the respective discourse trees;\nidentifying, between the first parse thicket and the second parse thicket, one or more common components, wherein the one or more common components include one or more of (i) a common part of speech, (ii) a common communicative action, (iii) a common rhetorical relation, or (iv) a common verb signature;\ncreating a generalized fragment comprising text that is associated with the one or more common components; and\nadding the generalized fragment to a training data set.\n2. The method of claim 1, further comprising training the classification model with the training data set.\n3. The method of claim 1, further comprising adding the first body of text and the second body of text to the training data set.\n4. The method of claim 1, further comprising identifying that a first domain-specific class from the first parse thicket matches a second-domain specific class from the second parse thicket.\n5. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\naccessing a corpus of text;\nparsing the corpus of text into a plurality of additional fragments; and\nselecting, from the plurality of additional fragments, the first body of text and the second body of text.\n6. The method of claim 1, further comprising translating the generalized fragment into a complete sentence.\n7. The method of claim 1, wherein the identifying comprises applying the classification model to the first parse thicket and the second parse thicket and obtaining, from the classification model, the one or more common components.\n8. The method of claim 1, further comprising filtering the generalized fragment based on sentiment, type of phrase, or length of phrase.\n9. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nidentifying, from the generalized fragment, a head noun phrase comprising an entity;\nmatching, in a predefined list, the head noun phrase to a class;\naccessing an additional fragment;\nidentifying, from the additional fragment, an additional head noun phrase;\nmatching, in the predefined list, the additional head noun phrase to an additional class;\ndetermining that the class and the additional class form a hierarchy; and\nproviding the class, the additional fragment, and the additional class to the training data set.\n10. The method of claim 1, wherein the first body of text represents a first sentence and the second body of text represents a second sentence.\n11. The method of claim 1, wherein the first body of text represents a first paragraph and the second body of text represents a second paragraph, and wherein the first parse thicket comprises a first set of additional syntactic trees and the second parse thicket comprises a second set of additional syntactic trees.\n12. A system comprising:\na non-transitory computer-readable medium storing computer-executable program instructions; and\na processing device communicatively coupled to the non-transitory computer-readable medium for executing the computer-executable program instructions, wherein executing the computer-executable program instructions configures the processing device to perform operations comprising:\nconstructing, for a first body of text comprising fragments, a first syntactic tree and a first discourse tree;\nconstructing, for a second body of text comprising fragments, a second syntactic tree and a second discourse tree, each discourse tree comprising terminal nodes and nonterminal nodes, wherein each terminal node is associated with one of the fragments of the respective body of text and each nonterminal node represents a rhetorical relationship between two of the fragments;\nmerging the first syntactic tree and the first discourse tree into a first parse thicket;\nmerging the second syntactic tree and the second discourse tree into a second parse thicket, wherein each parse thicket identifies one or more of the following: (i) two nouns in a different fragment represented by the respective syntactic trees, wherein each noun represents a common entity, or (ii) an additional rhetorical relation between fragments represented by the respective discourse trees;\nidentifying, between the first parse thicket and the second parse thicket, one or more common components, wherein the one or more common components include one or more of (i) a common part of speech, (ii) a common communicative action, (iii) a common rhetorical relation, or (iv) a common verb signature;\ncreating a generalized fragment comprising text that is associated with the one or more common components; and\nadding the generalized fragment to a training data set.\n13. The system of claim 12, wherein executing the computer-executable program instructions configures the processing device to perform operations comprising training a classification model with the training data set.\n14. The system of claim 12, wherein executing the computer-executable program instructions configures the processing device to perform operations comprising identifying that a first domain-specific class from the first parse thicket matches a second-domain specific class from the second parse thicket.\n15.

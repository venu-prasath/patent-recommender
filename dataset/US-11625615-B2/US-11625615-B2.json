    "abstract": "An artificial intelligence system for behavioral pattern matching and language generation includes at least a server. The system includes a behavior modification module operating on the at least a server, wherein the behavior modification module is designed and configured to receive at least a request for a behavior modification and generate a behavior modification model as a function of the at least a request for behavior modification. The system includes an artificial intelligence advisor operating on the at least a server, wherein the artificial intelligence advisor is configured to receive at least a user input from a user client device, generate at least a textual output using the behavior modification model and the at least a user input, and transmit the at least a textual output to the user client device.",

The artificial intelligence system of claim 1, wherein the at least a user input further comprises a textual input.\n3. The artificial intelligence system of claim 1, wherein the at least user input further comprises at least an element of metadata.\n4. The artificial intelligence system of claim 1, wherein the input analysis module further comprises a language processing module configured to map the at least a user input to the at least a query.\n5. The artificial intelligence system of claim 1, wherein the processing module is further configured to:\nretrieve at least a datum from a default response database using the conversational language query; and\ngenerate the conversational response using the at least a datum.\n6. The artificial intelligence system of claim 1, wherein the processing module further includes a user communication learner configured to generate the at least a conversational response using the conversational language query.\n7. The artificial intelligence system of claim 1, wherein the processing module is further configured to:\ndetermine that the at least a query includes an informational query; and\ngenerate an informational response using the informational query.\n8. The artificial intelligence system of claim 7, wherein the processing module is further configured to:\nretrieve at least a datum from the behavior modification model using the informational query; and\ngenerate the informational response using the at least a datum.\n9. An artificial intelligence method of behavioral pattern matching and language generation, the method comprising:\nreceiving, by at least a server, at least a request for a behavior modification;\ngenerating, by the at least a server, a behavior modification model as a function of the at least a request for behavior modification;\nreceiving, by the at least a server, at least an expert quality;\ngenerating, by the at least a server, an expert list as a function of the at least an expert quality and the at least a request for a behavior modification\nreceiving, by the at least a server, at least a user input from a user client device;\ngenerating, by the at least a server, at least a textual output using the behavior modification model and the at least a user input;\ntransmitting, by the at least a server, the at least a textual output to the user client device;\ngenerating, by the at least a server, a consultation module as a function of the textual output;\ndetecting, by the at least a server, a consultation event as a function of the consultation module and the textual output;\ngenerating at least a query using the at least a user input;\ndetermining that the at least a query includes a conversational language query;\ngenerating a conversational response using the conversational language query; and\nselecting, by the at least a server, at least an expert from the expert list as a function of the consultation event.\n10.

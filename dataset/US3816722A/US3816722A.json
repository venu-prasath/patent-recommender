    "title": "Computer for calculating the similarity between patterns and pattern recognition system comprising the similarity computer",
    "abstract": "The feature vectors of a sequence representative of a first pattern are correlated to those in another sequence representative of a second pattern in such a manner that the normalized sum of the quantities representative of the similarity between each feature vector of a sequence and at least one feature vector of the other sequence may assume an extremum. The extremum is used as the similarity measure to be calculated between the two patterns. With the pattern recognition system, the similarity measure is calculated for each reference pattern and a variable-length partial pattern to be recognized. The partial pattern is successively recognized to be a permutation with repetitions of reference patterns, each having the maximum similarity measure.",

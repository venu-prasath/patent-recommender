The method of claim 1, wherein registering the virtual model comprises:\ninitially registering the virtual model; and\nresponsive to determining that registration of the virtual model has been lost, re-registering the virtual model.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein registering the virtual model further comprises:\nregistering, based on the identified respective positions of the fiducial markers on the plurality of faces of the physical marker and one or more virtual markers, the virtual model of the portion of the bone with the corresponding observed portion of the bone.\n5. The method of claim 4, wherein registering the virtual model of the portion of the bone with the corresponding observed portion of the bone based on the one or more virtual markers comprises:\ngenerating, based on an alignment between the virtual model of the portion of the bone with a corresponding observed portion of the bone, a transformation matrix between the virtual model of the portion of the bone and the corresponding observed portion of the bone, wherein the transformation matrix provides a coordinate system for translating virtual guides indicated by the virtual surgical plan to the observed portion of the bone.\n6. The method of claim 5, further comprising determining the alignment by at least:\nreceiving user input to virtually position a virtual marker on a surface of the virtual model of the observed portion of the bone within a corresponding region of interest on a surface of the observed portion of the bone; and\nadjusting an orientation of the virtual model so that a virtual surface normal vector associated with the virtual marker is aligned with a real surface normal vector associated with the corresponding region of interest.\n7. The method of claim 6, wherein the region of interest is a center region of the glenoid or a center region of the humeral head.\n8. The method of claim 6, wherein receiving the user input comprises one or more of:\nreceiving motion data from one or more sensors of a visualization device;\nreceiving audio data indicating one or more voice commands; and\nreceiving data indicating the performance of one or more hand gestures.\n9. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\ndisplaying, via a visualization device and overlaid on the portion of the bone viewable via the visualization device, the virtual model of the portion of the bone.\n10. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\ndisplaying, via a visualization device and overlaid on the portion of the bone, a virtual guide that guides at least one of preparation of the bone for attachment of the prosthetic or attachment of the prosthetic to the bone.\n11. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nin response to determining that registration can be maintained without the physical marker remaining present outputting an indication that the physical marker may be removed.\n12. The method of claim 1, wherein the physical marker is a first physical marker, the method further comprising:\nobtaining, a virtual model of an instrument;\nidentifying, based on data obtained by the one or more optical sensors, respective positions of markers on a plurality of faces of a second physical marker positioned relative to the instrument; and\nregistering, based on the identified positions of the markers on the plurality of faces of the second physical marker, the virtual model of the instrument with a corresponding observed portion of the instrument.\n13. The method of claim 12, wherein registering the virtual model with the observed portion comprises:\nperiodically registering the virtual model with the observed portion.\n14. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\ndetermining a confidence of the registration of the virtual model by at least determining a confidence distance that represents a maximum distance between a point on the virtual model and a corresponding point on the observed portion of the bone.\n15. A mixed reality system comprising:\na memory that stores at least a portion of a virtual surgical plan for an orthopedic joint repair surgical procedure to attach a prosthetic to a bone of a patient;\na physical marker comprising a rectangular prism with a plurality of faces, wherein the physical marker comprises markers on the plurality of faces, wherein each of the markers on the plurality of faces comprises a different planar fiducial marker, and wherein at least a first face of the plurality of faces is not parallel to a second face of the plurality of faces such that a first planar fiducial marker of the markers is not parallel to a second planar fiducial marker of the markers;\none or more optical sensors; and\none or more processors configured to:\nobtain, a virtual model of a portion of the bone of the patient obtained from the virtual surgical plan;\nidentify, based on data obtained by the one or more optical sensors, respective positions of the planar fiducial markers on the plurality of faces of the physical marker attached to the bone of the patient; and\nregister, based on the identified positions, the virtual model of the portion of the bone with a corresponding observed portion of the bone.\n16. The mixed reality system of claim 15, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to:\nobtain a distance between a feature of a particular fiducial marker on a particular face of the plurality of faces and a tip of the physical marker; and\ndetermine, based on an identified position of the particular fiducial marker and the obtained distance, a position of the tip of the physical marker,\nwherein, to register the virtual model, the one or more processors are configured to register the virtual model based on the determined position of the tip.\n17. The mixed reality system of claim 15, wherein at least one of the markers comprises a border rectangle surrounding a plurality of other rectangles.\n18. A computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed, cause one or more processors of a mixed reality system to:\nobtain, a virtual model of a portion of a bone of an anatomy of a patient obtained from a virtual surgical plan for an orthopedic joint repair surgical procedure to attach a prosthetic to the bone;\nidentify, based on data obtained by one or more optical sensors, respective positions of markers on a plurality of faces of a polyhedron of a physical marker attached to the bone of the patient, wherein each of the markers on the plurality of faces comprises a different planar fiducial marker, and wherein at least a first face of the plurality of faces is not parallel to a second face of the plurality of faces such that a first planar fiducial marker of the markers is not parallel to a second planar fiducial marker of the markers; and\nregister, based on the identified respective positions, the virtual model of the portion of the bone with a corresponding observed portion of the bone.\n19.

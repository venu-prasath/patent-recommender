    "title": "System and method for storing and managing information",
    "abstract": "This invention is an information storage system which provides a self-contained environment for database management. Data are stored in the system not as conventional entries in memory locations, but instead as a group of connections between database sets. Procedures are also encoded as database set connections, and not in conventional form. Data and procedure cannot exist independently, in the present invention; instead, they are grouped together, into constructs called Contexts. Because the connections themselves are the data, the system is substantially independent of the particular hardware on which the system is implemented. The environment includes an editor which uses an icon-based syntax to create and manipulate data and procedure structures according to the invention. The present invention greatly reduces the time required to develop and maintain a database management system or other computer program. The system is not limited by the size of data variables. Also, a change in a data value, in one location, automatically changes that value throughout the system. Programs designed with the environment of the present invention are easier to code than conventional programs, and are generally self-documenting.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method of storing a textual document on a computer, the computer having a memory, the method comprising the steps of:\na) selecting a name for the document,\nb) dividing the document into at least two sections, each section being assigned a name, each name being represented as a box, each box being connected by a line to the name of the document, each box being disposed alongside another box,\nc) repeating step (b) for each box established in step (b), by establishing one or more \"child\" boxes corresponding to each box previously established, each child box containing at least some of the text of the document, wherein this step is repeated until all of the boxes established together contain all the text of the document,\nd) defining a plurality of nodes stored in the memory of the computer, each node having a unique identifier within the memory, each node corresponding to one of said boxes, and\ne) storing within each node at least one pointer, each pointer comprising only an identifier of another node, each pointer corresponding to one of said lines, wherein each node contains no application data elements other than said pointers, and wherein all information stored in the memory of the computer is stored only as a pattern of said pointers.\n2. A method of storing a representation of a project on a computer, the method comprising the steps of:\na) selecting the name of the project and representing that name by a box,\nb) dividing the project into subprojects, and representing each subproject by a \"child\" box, each child box being connected to the box established in step (a) by a line, each child box being located along side another child box, the child boxes being arranged in the order in which the subprojects are to be performed,\nc) repeating step (b) for each child box, thereby dividing each subproject into further subprojects, each subproject being arranged in the order in which it is to be performed, wherein step (c) is repeated until there are no more subprojects to be established, wherein there are a plurality of said lines connecting each of said boxes to another of said boxes,\nd) defining a plurality of nodes stored in the memory of the computer, each node having a unique identifier within the memory, each node corresponding to one of said boxes, and\ne) storing within each node at least one pointer, each pointer comprising only an identifier of another node, each pointer corresponding to one of said lines, wherein each node contains no application data elements other than said pointers, and wherein all information stored in the memory of the computer is stored only as a pattern of said pointers.\n3. The method of claim 2, wherein the boxes which have no child boxes are called lowest-level boxes, and wherein a box having a child box is called the owner box of the child box, the method further comprising the step of assigning, to each lowest-level box, an estimate of the time required to perform the subproject represented by that box, adding the estimates for each lowest-level box of a given owner box to obtain an estimate of the total time needed for completion of the project represented by that owner box, and adding the estimates so obtained for all such owner boxes to obtain a similar estimate for the owner boxes of the owner boxes, and repeating this procedure until one obtains an estimate of the total time required to complete the project.\n4. The method of claim 3, wherein the estimate of time for each lowest-level box is expressed as a minimum and a maximum, and wherein all estimates are obtained by adding the minima and maxima, thereby obtaining a final estimate of the minimum and maximum time for completion of the project.\n5. A method of using a computer to create a computer program, the computer having a memory, the method comprising the steps of:\na) dividing the program into a plurality of subtasks, each subtask being capable of being further subdivided into further subtasks, each subtask being represented by a box, the boxes depending from a given box being called the child boxes of that box, and the box from which a child box depends being called the owner box of that box, all boxes which have no child boxes being called \"lowest-level\" boxes,\nb) connecting the boxes together with lines to define a particular order in which the subtasks represented by the boxes are to be performed,\nc) wherein the lowest-level boxes represent pre-defined procedures, stored within the memory of the computer,\nd) defining a plurality of nodes stored in the memory of the computer, each node having a unique identifier within the memory, each node corresponding to one of said boxes, and\ne) storing within each node at least one pointer, each pointer comprising only an identifier of another node, each pointer corresponding to one of said lines, wherein each node contains no application data elements other than said pointers, and wherein all information stored in the memory of the computer is stored only as a pattern of said pointers.\n6. The method of claim 5, further comprising the step of creating a data structure on which the program is to operate, the creating step being performed by using steps (a) and (b) to create said data structure and by using steps (d) and (e) to store the data structure in the memory of the computer.",

    "abstract": "A behavior planner for a vehicle generates a plurality of conditional action sequences of the vehicle using a tree search algorithm and heuristics obtained from one or more machine learning models. Each sequence corresponds to a sequence of anticipated states of the vehicle. At least some of the action sequences are provided to a motion selector of the vehicle. The motion selector generates motion-control directives based on the received conditional action sequences and on data received from one or more sensors of the vehicle, and transmits the directives to control subsystems of the vehicle.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method, comprising:\nobtaining, at a first rate at a motion selector of a vehicle, one or more conditional action sequences generated with respect to the vehicle, wherein individual ones of the conditional action sequences correspond to a respective set of anticipated states of the vehicle;\nidentifying one or more motion-control directives at the motion selector, based at least in part on (a) the one or more conditional action sequences and (b) a set of sensor data obtained at a second rate that exceeds the first rate; and\ntransmitting, by the motion selector, the one or more motion-control directives to one or more motion control subsystems of the vehicle.\n2. The method as recited in claim 1, further comprising:\ngenerating at least one conditional action sequence of the one or more conditional action sequences using at least a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm.\n3.

The method as recited in claim 1, further comprising:\ngenerating at least one conditional action sequence of the one or more conditional action sequences based at least in part on statistical analysis of a set of actions taken under a particular set of driving conditions.\n7. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein identifying the one or more action control directives comprises identifying at least one action control directive based at least in part on an occupant comfort consideration.\n8. A system, comprising:\na motion selector of a vehicle implemented at one or more computing devices;\nwherein the motion selector is configured to:\nobtain, at a first rate, one or more conditional action sequences generated with respect to the vehicle, wherein individual ones of the conditional action sequences correspond to a respective set of anticipated states of the vehicle;\nidentify one or more motion-control directives, based at least in part on (a) the one or more conditional action sequences and (b) a set of sensor data obtained at a second rate that exceeds the first rate; and\ntransmit the one or more motion-control directives to one or more motion control subsystems of the vehicle.\n9.

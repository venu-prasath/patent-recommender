    "title": "Computer program version management system with reduced storage space and enabling multiple program versions to have the same name",
    "abstract": "A computer program version update system reduces storage space usage and enables calling programs to invoke any version of a program using the same name by storing only modified modules of a program for different program versions. Multiple versions of a program can thus have the same name. Any version of the program may be constructed from the modules upon command with a user issuing such a command and including a version number corresponding to the requested version as a parameter to invoke a program construction procedure.",

    "claims": "\n1. A system for constructing an executable version of a program having a plurality of versions, each of said versions being made up of compiled modular program portions constituting replaceable parts, with said parts including a set of data and procedures, comprising;\na configuration unit for storing a plurality of executable version entries, each entry representing an executable version of said program and specifying the ones of said replaceable parts required to construct the executable version of said program;\nmeans for storing a plurality of said modular program portions in compiled form as module revisions;\na plurality of module revision units, each revision unit selecting a module revision from said plurality of module revisions;\na version identifier indicating the executable version of the program to be constructed; and,\na program generator for receiving said version identifier, for reading a version entry from said configuration unit corresponding to said version identifier, for activating each of said revision units to select module revisions corresponding to said version identifier, and for generating the complete executable form of said program from selected module revisions.\n2. An apparatus for constructing an executable version of a program having a plurality of versions, each executable version being constructable from a set of modular revisions comprising:\na repository having a plurality of subdirectories, each subdirectory including at least one previously compiled executable previously compiled modular revision;\nmeans including means for generating a set of revision numbers corresponding to a desired previously compiled executable version of said program for selecting a set of executable revisions from said repository according to said set of revision numbers; and,\nmeans for receiving said version number, activating said means for selecting, providing the set of revision numbers to the means for selecting according to said version number, and generating the executable version of the program from the selected set of revisions to construct the executable version of the program.",

    "abstract": "Techniques and architectures for providing notifications regarding events, such as hurricanes, tornados, fires, floods, earthquakes, and so on, are discussed herein. For example, a user interface may be displayed with a map of a geographical area, an event visual representation representing an event, and an impact visual representation indicating an impact area where the event is estimated to impact. A request may be received to notify users associated with the impact area and customized notifications may be sent to users associated with the impact area. The customized notifications may be based on policy data for the users.",

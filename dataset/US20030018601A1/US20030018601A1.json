    "title": "Execution of multiple models using data segmentation",
    "abstract": "A method executed on a computer for modeling expected behavior is described. The method includes scoring records of a dataset that is segmented into a plurality of data segments using a plurality of models and converting scores of the records into probability estimates. Two of the techniques described for converting scores into probability estimates are a technique that transforms scores into the probabilities estimates based on an equation and a binning technique that establishes a plurality of bins and maps records based on a score for the record to one of the plurality of bins.",

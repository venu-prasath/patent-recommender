    "abstract": "Techniques for analyzing and synthesizing complex knowledge representations (KRs) may utilize an atomic knowledge representation model including an elemental data structure and knowledge processing rules that are machine-readable. The elemental data structure may include a universal kernel and customized modules, which may represent knowledge that is generally applicable to a population and knowledge that is specifically applicable to individual data consumers, respectively. A method of constructing an elemental data structure may include analyzing first information to identify a first elemental component associated with a data consumer, and adding the first elemental component to a customized module corresponding to the data consumer. The method may also include analyzing second information to identify a second elemental component associated with a population, and adding the second elemental component to the universal kernel.",

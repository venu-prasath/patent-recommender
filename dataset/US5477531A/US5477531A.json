    "title": "Method and apparatus for testing a packet-based network",
    "abstract": "In packet-based networks (10), it is often desired to test communications between two specific stations (11, 12). This can generally be effected from a first one of the stations (11) by requesting the other station (12) to `loop-back` a test packet sent from the first station. The first station (11), on receiving back the test packet, can thereby ascertain that not only is communication with the other station (12) possible, but it can also measure the round trip time. However, more complex characteristics of the transmission path between the stations (11, 12) are not ascertainable in this manner. The transmission of a predetermined sequence of packets permits such characteristics to be determined by observing the effect of the network (10) on the sequence considered as a whole. Thus by varying packet size in a sequence, characteristics such as bandwidth, propagation delay, queuing delay and the network's internal packet size can be derived. The use of bursts of packets enables buffer size and re-sequencing characteristics to be determined.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method of testing a packet-based network to ascertain characteristics of packet transmission between first and second nodes on the network, said method comprising the steps of transmitting packets between said first and second nodes; receiving the packets at one of said nodes; and correlating packet transmission and reception to derive correlation data indicative of a first of said transmission characteristics; transmitting said packets as a sequence in which the packets are in a predetermined relationship to each other with at least one parameter of the packets in said sequence varying over the sequence; deriving said correlation data so as to relate the correlation data to one parameter of said at least one parameter; and determining a second of said characteristics of transmission by examination of the relation between the correlation data and said parameter over said sequence.\n2. A method according to claim 1, wherein said at least one parameter comprises at least one of inter-packet spacing, packet size and packet position sequence.\n3. A method according to claim 2, wherein said at least one parameter is packet size, said sequence of packets comprising for each of a multiplicity of packet sizes, a respective plurality of packets, the packets of said sequence being transmitted in isolation from each other.\n4. A method according to claim 3, wherein said correlation data comprises the minimum packet journey time for each packet size, said minimum journey time being graphically displayed against packet size whereby to enable the bandwidth and/or propagation delay between said first and second nodes to be determined.\n5. A method according to claim 3, wherein said correlation data comprises the minimum packet journey time for each packet size, said method further comprising the step of processing said correlation data to derive the network bandwidth and/or propagation delay between said first and second nodes.\n6. A method according to claim 3, wherein said correlation data comprises the mean packet journey time for each packet size, said mean journey times being graphically displayed against packet size to enable the internal network packet size to be determined.\n7.

A method according to claim 3, wherein said correlation data comprises the minimum and mean packet journey times for each packet size, said minimum and mean journey times being graphically displayed against packet size whereby to enable the mean queuing delay between said first and second nodes to be determined.\n9. A method according to claim 3, wherein said correlation data comprises the minimum and mean packet journey times for each packet size, said method further comprising the step of processing said correlation data to derive the mean queuing time between said first and second nodes.\n10. A method according to claim 2, wherein said at least one parameter is inter-packet spacing and packet position said sequence of packets comprising a succession of isolated packet bursts each made up of a plurality of packets transmitted immediately one after another, said correlation data indication for said at least one parameter expressed as packet position within said bursts as transmitted, the average packet loss rate whereby to enable the minimum buffer capacity between said nodes to be determined.\n11. A method according to claim 2, wherein said at least one parameter is inter-packet spacing and packet position said sequence of packets comprising at least one isolated packet burst made up of a plurality of packets that are transmitted immediately one after another and are of decreasing size, said correlation data indicating any difference in packet sequencing between the said at least one burst as transmitted and as received.\n12. A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said packets are transmitted from said first node and looped-back at said second node for reception at said first node, said correlation data being derived by comparing packet transmission and reception at said first node.\n13. A method according to any of claims 1-11, wherein said packets are transmitted from said first node and received at said second node where reception data is derived indicative of parameters of packet reception at said second node, said reception data being transmitted back to said first node to be used as, or in deriving, said correlation data.\n14. Apparatus for testing a packet-based network to ascertain characteristics of packet transmission between first and second nodes on the network, said apparatus comprising transmission means for transmitting packets between said first and second nodes, receiving means for receiving the packets of one of said nodes, and correlation means for correlating packet transmission and reception to derive correlation data indicative of a first of said packet transmission characteristics; said transmission means being operative to transmit said packets as a sequence in which the packets are in a predetermined relationship to each other with at least one parameter of the packets in said sequence varying over the sequence; said correlation means being operative to derive said correlation data so as to relate it to one parameter of said at least one parameter; and means for determining a second of said packet transmission characteristics of transmission by examination of the relation between the correlation data and said one parameter over said sequence.",

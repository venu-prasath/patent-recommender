    "abstract": "A method that improves the training of predictive models. Better trained predictive models make better predictions, and can classify transactions with reduced levels of false positives and false negative. Included is an apparatus for executing a data clean-up algorithm that harmonizes a wide range of real world supervised and unsupervised training data into a single, error-free, uniformly formatted record file that has every field coherent and well populated with information.",

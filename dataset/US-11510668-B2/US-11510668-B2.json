    "abstract": "A surgical stapling apparatus includes a cartridge assembly defining a tissue contacting surface; an anvil assembly defining a tissue contacting surface; and a surgical buttress releasably secured to at least one of the tissue contacting surface of the cartridge assembly and the tissue contacting surface of the anvil assembly by at least one anchor. A loading unit includes a surgical buttress releasably secured to an anvil assembly and/or a staple cartridge secured thereto by at least one anchor, and a drive assembly including a knife blade, wherein movement of the drive assembly from a proximal position to a distal position results in the knife blade cutting the at least one anchor and freeing each surgical buttress from the anvil assembly and/or cartridge assembly.",

    "title": "Information processing system using threshold passive modification",
    "abstract": "An adaptive information processing system includes input terminals adapted to receive N input signals s1, s2, . . . sN representing an \"input\"; output terminals adapted to present n output responses r1, R2, . . . rn representing a \"response\"; and information processing apparatus, connecting the input with the output terminals, and operative to carry out the processing steps required to \"map\" different inputs into responses in accordance with a particular passive modification algorithm. This algorithm permits the recognition of unknown inputs and separates inputs which are in different classes but which are originally close to one another.",

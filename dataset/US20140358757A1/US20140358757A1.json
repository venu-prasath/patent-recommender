    "title": "System and method for providing latency protection for trading orders",
    "abstract": "A system for managing trading orders comprises a memory operable to store an order associated with a first price. The system further comprises a processor communicatively coupled to the memory and operable to identify a latency value. The processor is further operable to receive a counterorder and to identify a potential trade associated with the order and the counterorder, the potential trade based at least in part on the first price. If the latency value satisfies a configurable condition, the processor is further operable to initiate a configurable period of time. If the potential trade is not valid upon expiration of the configurable period, the processor is further operable to prevent the execution of the potential trade.",

    "claims": "\n1. A system, comprising:\na memory operable to store an order associated with a first price;\na processor communicatively coupled to the memory and operable to:\nidentify a latency value;\nreceive a counterorder;\nidentify a potential trade associated with the order and the counterorder, the potential trade based at least in part on the first price;\nif the latency value satisfies a configurable condition, initiate a configurable period of time; and\nif the potential trade is not valid upon expiration of the configurable period, prevent the execution of the potential trade.\n2-15. (canceled)\n16. A method comprising:\ndetermining, by at least one processor, a latency value;\nreceiving, by the at least one processor, an order associated with a first price;\nreceiving, by the at least one processor, a counterorder;\nidentifying, by the at least one processor, a potential trade associated with the order and the counterorder, the potential trade based at least in part on the first price;\ndetermining, by the at least one processor, whether the determined latency value satisfies a configurable condition, in which the act of determining whether the latency value satisfies the configurable condition comprises determining that the latency value satisfies the configurable condition;\nbased on the act of determining that the determined latency value satisfies the configurable condition, initiating, by the at least one processor, a configurable period of time; and\ndetermining whether the potential trade is valid upon expiration of the configurable period of time, in which the act of determining whether the potential trade is valid upon expiration of the configurable period comprises determining that the potential trade is not valid upon expiration of the configurable period;\nbased on the act of determining that the potential trade is not valid upon expiration of the configurable period, causing, by the at least one processor, the potential trade to not be executed.\n17. The method of claim 16, wherein determining the latency value comprises:\nsubmitting a test order to a trading platform at a first time;\nreceiving, at a second time, an acceptance message associated with the test order; and\ncalculating the latency value based at least in part on the first time and the second time,\nwherein the test order is associated with an artificial trading product such that the trading platform prevents execution of the test order,\nwherein the counterorder is associated with a second price that matches the first price, and\nwherein the identification of the potential trade is based at least in part on the second price matching the first price.\n18-20. (canceled)\n21. The method of claim 16, further comprising:\nupon expiration of the configurable period, determining whether the potential trade is valid;\nreceiving, prior to expiration of the configurable period, a command to cancel the order;\n22. The method of claim 16, further comprising:\nupon expiration of the configurable period, determining whether the potential trade is valid;\nreceiving, prior to expiration of the configurable period, a command to adjust the first price associated with the order;\n23-24. (canceled)\n25. The method of claim 16, further comprising:\nif the potential trade is valid upon expiration of the configurable period, executing the potential trade,\nwherein the potential trade is valid if the order matches the counterorder upon expiration of the configurable period, and\nwherein the configurable condition is based at least in part on price volatility associated with a trading platform.\n26-29. (canceled)\n30. A non-transitory computer-readable medium having instructions stored thereon configured to cause at least one processor to:\nidentify a latency value;\nreceive a counterorder;\nidentify a potential trade associated with the order and the counterorder, the potential trade based at least in part on the first price;\nif the latency value satisfies a configurable condition, initiate a configurable period of time; and\nif the potential trade is not valid upon expiration of the configurable period, prevent the execution of the potential trade.\n31. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 30, in which the instructions are further configured to cause the at least one processor to determine the latency value, and wherein determining the latency value comprises:\nsubmitting a test order to a trading platform at a first time;\nreceiving, at a second time, an acceptance message associated with the test order; and\ncalculating the latency value based at least in part on the first time and the second time.\n32. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 31, wherein the test order is associated with an artificial trading product such that the trading platform prevents execution of the test order.\n33. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 30, wherein:\nthe counterorder is associated with a second price that matches the first price; and\nthe identification of the potential trade is based at least in part on the second price matching the first price.\n34. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 30, in which the instructions are further configured to cause the at least one processor to determine whether the potential trade is valid upon expiration of the configurable period.\n35. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 34,\nin which the instructions are further configured to cause the at least one processor to receive, prior to expiration of the configurable period, a command to cancel the order; and\nin which the instructions are further configured to cause the at least one processor to determine that the potential trade is invalid based at least in part on the received cancel command.\n36. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 34, wherein:\nin which the instructions are further configured to cause the at least one processor to receive, prior to expiration of the configurable period, a command to adjust the first price associated with the order; and\nin which the instructions are further configured to cause the at least one processor to determine that the potential trade is invalid based at least in part on the received adjust command.\n37. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 30, wherein the configurable period is based at least in part on the latency value.\n38. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 30, wherein preventing the execution of the potential trade comprises deleting the order.\n39. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 30, in which the instructions are further configured to cause the at least one processor to execute the potential trade if the potential trade is valid upon expiration of the configurable period.\n40. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 39, wherein the potential trade is valid if the order matches the counterorder upon expiration of the configurable period.\n41. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 30, wherein the configurable condition is satisfied if the latency value satisfies a configurable threshold.\n42. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 30, wherein the configurable condition is based at least in part on price volatility associated with a trading platform.\n43. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 30, wherein:\ninitiating a configurable period of time comprises storing in a timer queue an entry associated with the identified potential trade; and\nthe timer queue is associated with a callback function to determine whether the order matches the counterorder upon expiration of the configurable period.",

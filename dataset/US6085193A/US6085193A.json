    "title": "Method and system for dynamically prefetching information via a server hierarchy",
    "abstract": "A method and system for prefetching data for clients associated with a proxy server hierarchy and an enhanced content server data transfer to the clients. The method for prefetching data identifies data access patterns and prefetches select information based on a dynamic interpretation of the data access patterns. The content server or proxy server identifies data access reference patterns of clients associated with the content server or the proxy server hierarchy. The data access patterns are preferably stored in a statistics table. The content server generates prefetch hint information based on inputs from the statistics table. The prefetch hint information annotates requested information or objects requested by the clients. The prefetch hint information optimally is updated as the requested information passes through the proxy server hierarchy. The prefetch hint information annotates the requested information requested by the clients. The ultimate decision to prefetch select information for the clients is made based on the prefetch hint information and prefetch hint values. The prefetch hint value is calculated based on local node-specific factors, such as storage constraints and access time.",

    "title": "Harmonic speech coding arrangement where a set of parameters for a continuous magnitude spectrum is determined by a speech analyzer and the parameters are used by a synthesizer to determine a spectrum which is used to determine senusoids for synthesis",
    "abstract": "A harmonic coding arrangement where the magnitude spectrum of the input speech is modeled at the analyzer by a relatively small set of parameters and, significantly, as a continuous rather than only a line magnitude spectrum. The synthesizer, rather than the analyzer, determines the magnitude, frequency, and phase of a large number of sinusoids which are summed to generate synthetic speech. Rather than receiving information explicitly defining the sinusoids from the analyzer, the synthesizer receives the small set of parameters and uses those parameters to determine a spectrum, which, in turn, is used by the synthesizer to determine the sinusoids for synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Enterprise Hypothesis Orchestration provides users an intuitive system for building an inquiry model that thereafter creates and evaluates each of a plurality of hypotheses as it continuously searches for evidence to formulate, score, and resolve each hypothesis. The Enterprise Hypothesis Orchestration system moreover continuously deals with the uncertainty caused by noisy, missing, inaccurate, and/or contradictory data. The present invention uses abductive reasoning to infer the best explanation or hypothesis for a set of observations. Given an inquiry the Hypothesis Orchestration System identifies relevant data from which to form a plurality of hypotheses. It thereafter collects evidence in support of each hypothesis and crafts a degree of confidence that the hypothesis is true. If a hypothesis is found to lack support an analysis of any missing evidence is conducted to identify and seek which evidence would offer the highest benefit to resolving one or more of the plurality of hypotheses.",

    "title": "Systems and methods for operating data card terminals for transaction chargeback protection",
    "abstract": "Systems and methods for operating a data card terminal, such as a credit card transaction terminal, for providing chargeback protection services for the benefit of merchants are disclosed. The terminal includes a transaction terminal comprising an embossed character reader and magnetic stripe reader, with a separate signature capture printer. The transaction terminal is operative for detecting the physical presence of a data card during a card transaction. The embossed character reader employs a tactile imager and pattern recognition for detecting the embossed characters on the data card. A signature capturing printer prints a paper receipt, which is signed by a cardholder at a signature capturing window on the printer. A signature capturing system digitizes and compresses signals corresponding to the signature of the card holder. Transaction data including compressed signature signals and signals indicative of the presence of the card are transmitted to the host computer system of a transaction processor, who guarantees the transaction as chargeback-protected under certain circumstances. Also disclosed are methods for providing electronic and off-line transaction authorizations.",

    "abstract": "Techniques disclosed herein relate generally to constructing a customized knowledge graph. In one embodiment, entities and relations among entities are extracted from a user dataset based on certain rules to generate a seed graph. Large-scale knowledge graphs are then traversed using a finite state machine to identify candidate entities and/or relations to add to the seed graph. A priority function is used to select entities and/or relations from the candidate entities and/or relations. The selected entities and/or relations are then added to the seed graph to generate the customized knowledge graph.",

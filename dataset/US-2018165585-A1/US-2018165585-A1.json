    "abstract": "A method, system and computer-usable medium for providing cognitive insights comprising receiving data from a plurality of data sources, at least some of the plurality of data sources comprising procurement related data sources and blockchain data sources; processing the data from the plurality of data sources to provide a cognitively processed procurement-related, blockchain-associated insight; and, providing the cognitively processed procurement-related, blockchain-associated insight to a destination.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method for providing procurement related cognitive insights comprising:\nreceiving data from a plurality of data sources, at least some of the plurality of data sources comprising procurement related data sources and blockchain data sources;\nprocessing the data from the plurality of data sources to provide a cognitively processed procurement-related, blockchain-associated insight; and,\nproviding the cognitively processed procurement-related, blockchain-associated insight to a destination.\n2. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nperforming a single step procurement operation using the cognitively processed procurement-related, blockchain-associated insight.\n3. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nperforming a learning operation to iteratively improve the cognitively processed procurement-related, blockchain-associated insight over time.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein:\nthe plurality of data sources comprise at least one of situational data sources and temporal data sources, the situational data sources comprising a procurement related situational data source, the temporal data sources comprising a procurement related temporal data source; and,\nthe blockchain data comprises procurement related blockchain transaction data.\n5. The method of claim 1, wherein:\nthe cognitively processed procurement-related, blockchain-associated insight is associated with a procurement compliance requirement.\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein:\nthe cognitively processed procurement-related, blockchain-associated insight relates to at least one of a sourcing operation, a contract management operation, supplier management operation, procure-to-pay operation, a spend analysis operation, a strategic planning operation and a risk and compliance operation."

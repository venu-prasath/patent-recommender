    "title": "System for ranking search results from a collection of documents using spreading activation techniques",
    "abstract": "A system and method for ranking the results of a search on a collection of linked documents. Documents found on the Web are typically referred to as Web pages. The system utilizes various information relating to the collection of linked documents, including the topology, content and historical usage of the linked collections of documents. The ranking is based on historical patterns and information about the current context of interest (e.g. what the user or group seems to be currently interested in doing). A spreading activation technique is used to identify the frequency of activation of the documents in the search results. Spreading activation techniques are based on representations of Web pages as nodes in graph networks representing usage, content, and hypertext relations among Web pages. After performing the spreading activation based on an initial set defined by the search results, each document from the results may be ranked based on their level of activation.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for ranking the results of a search on a collection of linked documents, said method comprising the steps of:\n2. The method as recited in claim 1 wherein said step of generating historical information for said collection of linked documents, its links, access and traversal patterns through said collection of linked documents is further comprised of the steps of:\n3. The method as recited in claim 2 further comprising the step of: e) presenting said ordered search results to a user wherein documents having a higher level of activation are in a higher order position.\n4. A system for providing a ranking for a set of documents representing search results from a collection of linked documents comprising:\n5. The system as recited in claim 4 wherein said means for generating historical information regarding the usage of said collection of linked documents is further comprised of:\n6. The system as recited in claim 5 wherein said spreading activation means is further comprised of\n7. A system for submitting search requests to collections of linked documents and obtaining results ordered based on historical usage comprising:\n8. The system as recited in claim 7 wherein said access prediction module is further comprised of:\n9. The system as recited in claim 8 wherein said ordering module is further comprised of circuitry for identifying activation information for each document in said search result and circuitry for presenting said search results in an order based on the activation information for each document in said search results.",

    "title": "Fire alarm system",
    "abstract": "A fire alarm system which makes fire determination based on a novel idea which considers various changes of the physical phenomena in the surroundings caused in relation with the occurrence of a fire in terms of changes of vectors. These changes in the physical phenomena are detected by the detecting section in the form of analog data and processed by a data sampling section as sampled data and stored in a storing section in such a manner as discriminating them by the detecting sections. The tendencies of the changes are computed in a first computing section and the vectors representing the present or future conditions of the physical phenomena are computed from the sampled data. The vector is compared in a comparing section with a preliminarily set data related to the fire detection and when the relation therebetween is not a predetermined one, an alarm is given through an alarming section.",

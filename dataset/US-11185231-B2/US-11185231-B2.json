    "abstract": "Intelligent multi-scale image parsing determines the optimal size of each observation by an artificial agent at a given point in time while searching for the anatomical landmark. The artificial agent begins searching image data with a coarse field-of-view and iteratively decreases the field-of-view to locate the anatomical landmark. After searching at a coarse field-of view, the artificial agent increases resolution to a finer field-of-view to analyze context and appearance factors to converge on the anatomical landmark. The artificial agent determines applicable context and appearance factors at each effective scale.",

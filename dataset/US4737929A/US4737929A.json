    "title": "Highly parallel computation network employing a binary-valued T matrix and single output amplifiers",
    "abstract": "Advantageous neural network realizations are achieved by employing only negative gain amplifiers and a clipped T matrix having conductances Tij which have only two values. Preferably, one of these values is a preselected value set by the value of a fixed resistor, and the other value is zero, created simply with an open circuit. Values for the Tij terms of the clipped T matrix are obtained through an iterative process which operates on the clipped and nonclipped matrices and minimizes the error resulting from the use of the clipped T matrix.",

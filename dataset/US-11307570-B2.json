    "abstract": "A predictive maintenance server receives data from sensors of equipment. The server uses one or more machine learning models to assign an anomaly score. Responsive to the anomaly score exceeding a threshold value, the server may issue an alert. The machine learning model may be supervised or unsupervised. In one embodiment, the machine learning model use several sensor channels to predict the values of one or more vitals of the equipment and compare the predicted values to the actual measured values of the vitals. The server may assign an anomaly score based on the differences between the predicted values and the measured values. In one embodiment, the machine learning model may be an autoencoder that generates a distribution of the measurement values to determine the likelihood of observing the actual measured values in a normal operation. In one embodiment, the server may use a histogram approach to predict anomaly.",

    "title": "System and method for maintaining a shared cache look-up table",
    "abstract": "An information system and method for reducing workload load on servers in an information system network. The system defines a group of interconnected clients which have associated cache memories. The system maintains a shared group cache look-up table for the group having entries which identify data items cached by the clients within the group and identify the clients at which the data items are cached. Each client in the group has access to the group cache look-up table, and any client or group can cache any data item. The system can include a hierarchy of groups, with each group having a group cache look-up table. The group cache look-up tables minimize requests for data items outside the groups and greatly minimize the service load on servers having popular data items.",

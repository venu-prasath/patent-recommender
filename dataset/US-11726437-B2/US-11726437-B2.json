    "abstract": "Apparatuses, systems, and methods are provided for the utilization of vehicle control systems to cause a vehicle to take preventative action responsive to the detection of a near short term adverse driving scenario. A vehicle control system may receive information corresponding to vehicle operation data and ancillary data. Based on the received vehicle operation data and the received ancillary data, a multi-dimension risk score module may calculate risk scores associated with the received vehicle operation data and the received ancillary data. Subsequently, the vehicle control systems may cause the vehicle to perform at least one of a close call detection action and a close call detection alert to lessen the risk associated with the received vehicle operation data and the received ancillary data.",

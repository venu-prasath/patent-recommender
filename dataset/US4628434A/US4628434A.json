    "title": "Facilities control method",
    "abstract": "A control system employs a controller for controlling the operation of a plurality of facilities and a memory which stores information employed by the controller for controlling the operation of the facilities. The memory includes a first portion for storing facility status signals and command signals, a second portion which stores a series of rules which are triggered in response to status information from the respective facilities, a portion which converts the rules into internal codes, and a portion which stores the results of the application of the internal codes to control commands. The controller monitors facility status signals and controls the generation of facility status signals. It also controls which rule set number is to be used in accordance with information stored in memory and contains an internal code generator for generating the internal codes corresponding to generated facility status signals. The controller reads out rules from memory based upon the rule sets being employed and generates control command signals in accordance with data stored in memory. From these signals, command signals are generated for controlling the operation of the facilities.",

    "claims": "\n1. A control system having a controller for controlling the operation of a plurality of facilities in real time, and memory, coupled to said controller, for storing information in accordance with which said controller controls the operation of said facilities, wherein\nsaid memory comprises\nfirst memory means for storing facility status signals representative of the statuses of the facilities, command signals responsive to said status signals and information representative of correspondence between said status signals, said command signals and internal codes,\nsecond memory means for storing information for specifying a series of rules to be triggered in accordance with the statuses of the facilities,\nthird memory means for storing rules converted into said internal codes, and\nfourth memory means for storing internal codes of conclusions sequentially formed in accordance with the operation of control commands for corresponding facilities on the basis of the internal codes representative of the statuses of the facilities and internal codes representative of rules, and finally determined internal codes, and wherein\nsaid controller comprises\nsettling means for monitoring the facility status signals and controlling the generation of said facility status signals, and the number of rule-set for use on the basis of the information stored in said second memory means,\ninternal code generating means for generating internal codes corresponding to said generated facility status signals on the basis of the information stored in said first memory means,\ndetermining means for reading out corresponding rules from said third memory means on the basis of said number of the rule set having been determined by said settling means and for determining a final control command in accordance with information stored in said fourth memory means, and\ncommand signal generating means for generating a command signal for a facility in accordance with an internal code for a determined control command on the basis of the information stored in said first memory means.\n2. A control system according to claim 1, wherein said fourth memory means comprises a first table for storing parameter parts of internal codes representative of occurred statuses of facilities, and parameter parts of internal codes of conclusions formed according to the rules, a second table for storing continuing pointers for coupling, within said first table, parameter parts of the aforementioned internal codes having the same fixed parts, and a third table for storing head pointers for indicting the heads of series of parameter parts coupled by continuing pointers for the respective same fixed parts.",

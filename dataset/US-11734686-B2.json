    "abstract": "Methods and systems for using block chain technology to verify transaction data are described herein. A computing platform may receive data about events related to transactions, personal or corporate information, supply chains, and other relevant information about a person or corporate entity. The event information may be received, aggregated, and processed to determine metadata about the person or corporate entity. The metadata may indicate, for example, a trustworthiness of the person or corporate entity for various purposes. Such event information and/or metadata may be stored as transactions in a block chain that may be accessible by counterparties to a potential transaction involving the person or corporate entity. The automated event processing computing platform may further use automated techniques to implement smart transactions between the person/entity and counterparty based on the trust metadata.",

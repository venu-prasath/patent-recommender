    "abstract": "An infrastructure is provided for improving the safety of autonomous systems. An autonomous vehicle management system (AVMS) controls one or more autonomous functions or operations performed by a vehicle or machine such that the autonomous operations are performed in a safe manner. The AVMS uses various artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques (e.g., neural networks, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, etc.) and models as part of its processing. For an inferring data point, for which a prediction is made by AVMS using an AI model, the AVMS checks how statistically similar (or dissimilar) the inferring data point is to the distribution of the training dataset. A score (confidence score) is generated indicative of how similar or dissimilar the inferring data point is to the training dataset. The AVMS uses this confidence score to decide how the prediction made by the AI model is to be used.",

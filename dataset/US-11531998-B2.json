    "abstract": "The present disclosure is directed toward systems, methods, and non-transitory computer readable media for generating conversational survey questions. The systems and methods analyze a received survey question response to identify characteristics of a survey response, including topics and other response features. For example, the systems can determine a sentiment associated with a given product or service that a respondent expresses within a response. Based on the determined sentiment, and further based on a set of logic rules received from a survey administrator, the systems and methods generate provide conversational follow-up questions associated with the identified product or service.",

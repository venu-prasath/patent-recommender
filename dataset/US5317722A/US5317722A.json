    "title": "Dynamically adapting multiple versions on system commands to a single operating system",
    "abstract": "Multiple versions of a given system command are run on a single operating system by using one command processing program per command irrespective of its version. Each version of the command has a command definition which has the same format for all counterparts of the command. A command analyzer program transforms the parameters of a command character string into the correct data form for its command processing program based on the command definition for that version of the command. Multiple sets of command definitions are placed in separate storage directories called libraries. The libraries are searched based on a version identifier to find the command definition for a command. The version identifier may be specified as a program attribute, entered interactively or entered by the system. Multiple programs written with different versions of commands may be run in conjunction with each other and the system will dynamically adapt to the version of each program as it is running. Also more than one command definition library may be searched to process a command. Therefore, commands written in various versions may be embedded in the same program and the system will dynamically adapt to multiple versions of commands in a program.",

    "claims": "\n1. A computer system for executing user programs having different versions of system commands, the computer system comprising:\na command execution means for executing system commands having a format common to all versions;\na library for storing a first version of system commands in the common format;\na library for storing a second version of system commands in the common format;\nmeans for searching said libraries while executing said user programs for system commands invoked by the user programs;\nmeans responsive to the user program for determining the sequence in which said libraries are searched while executing the user program;\nsaid command execution means coupled to receive commands from said libraries for executing common format system commands invoked by said user programs, wherein both version of system commands are executed by the same command execution program executing the respective common format of each system command without regard to the version of the system command invoked by the user program.\n2. The computer system of claim 1 wherein the means for determining the sequence in which said libraries are searched comprises:\nmeans for identifying from each program the version of system commands to use in executing the commands of that program; and\nmeans responsive to said identifying means for providing version identification to the searching means so that the searching means first searches the library identified by the identifying means.\n3. A method for dynamically adapting multiple versions of computer system command to the computer's operating system comprising the steps of:\nretrieving from the computer system commands the command character string and option information related to the command to be processed by the operating system;\nretrieving a command definition for the command based on said option information, said step of retrieving a command definition being performed at time of command execution;\ntransforming the command character string in accordance with the command definition into transformed data formatted for command processing, said step of transforming the command character string being performed at tie of command execution; and\nprocessing the transformed data with the command processing program assigned to that command and all its version counterparts in order to execute any version of the command.\n4. The method of claim 3 wherein said option information includes a version identifier.\n5. The method of claim 4 wherein said command definition retrieving step comprises the steps of:\ncollecting each version of a command definition in a predetermined version library so that all command definitions for a given version are in a single library;\ndetecting the version identifier of a command from the option information; and\nsearching the version library identified by the version identifier to retrieve the command definition.\n6. The method of claim 5 wherein said searching step further comprises:\nsearching multiple libraries in a pre-defined sequence until the command definition is found.\n7. The method of claim 3 wherein said command definitions for all counterpart commands in the multiple versions of a command have a predetermined format associated with the command processing step that executes all the counterpart commands.\n8. The method of claim 7 wherein the predetermined command definition format has the same number of parameters for all counterpart versions of a command.\n9. The method of claim 7 wherein the predetermined command definition format has the same sequence of parameters for all counterpart versions of a command.\n10. A method for executing a plurality of system commands written in differing versions of a computer's operating system, aid method comprising the steps of:\ndefining a set of system commands in a universal format, wherein each system command on any version of the operating system has a counterpart system command in said set, and wherein at least one command in said set is the counterpart of more than one command in different versions of the operating system;\ninvoking a system command to be executed;\ndetermining the version of the operating system in which the command to be executed is written, said determining step being performed in response to said invoking step;\ntransforming the command character string of the command to be executed with a command analyzer into a character string constituting the counterpart of said command in said set of commands in a universal format, said command analyzer being responsive to the version of the operating system in which said command is written, said transforming step being performed after said invoking step; and\nexecuting the command character string constituting the counterpart of said command to be executed in said set of commands in a universal format.\n11. The method for executing a plurality of commands written in differing versions of a computer's operating system of claim 10, wherein said step of transforming the command character string comprises the steps of:\ncreating a set of command definitions for each version of the computer's operating system, said set of command definitions having one command definition for each command in said version of the operating system;\nretrieving the command definition of the command to be executed for the version of the operating system in which said command is written; and\ntransforming the command character string with a command analyzer in accordance with the command definition into a character string constituting the counterpart of said command in said set of commands in a universal format.\n12. The method for executing a plurality of commands written in differing versions of a computer's operating system of claim 10, wherein said step of determining the version of the operating system in which a command to be executed is written comprises associating a version identifier with said command to be executed.\n13. The method for executing a plurality of commands written in differing versions of a computer's operating system of claim 12, wherein said step of transforming the command character string comprises the steps of:\ncreating a set of command definitions for each version of the computer's operating system, said set of command definitions having one command definition for each command in said version of the operating system;\ncollecting each version of command definition in a predetermined version library so that all command definitions for a given version are in a single library;\ndetecting the version identifier associated with the command to be executed;\nsearching the version library identified by the version identifier to retrieve the command definition; and\ntransforming the command character string with a command analyzer in accordance with the command definition into a character string constituting the counterpart of said command in said set of commands in a universal format.",

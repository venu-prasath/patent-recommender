    "title": "Graphics image manipulation",
    "abstract": "In an image source for multimedia applications such as networked computer games, a graphics engine (16) generates pixel images one line at a time using a scan-line algorithm and supplies the generated scan lines to an encoder (18) where they are buffered. The encoder codes the buffered pixel data as macroblocks of, for example 16\u00d716 pixels according to MPEG or similar standards. When the graphics engine has sent sufficient scan lines for a first macroblock to the encoder, it sends a signal (FLAG) on receipt of which the encoder begins coding the pixel data as a macroblock in a line of macroblocks whilst continuing to receive scan lines from the graphics engine (16). To increase encoder efficiency, the graphics engine specifies to the encoder global (GMV) and macroblock (BMV) motion vectors for substantially all or selected ones of the macroblocks of an image respectively. Completed coded macroblock lines may be sent to a remote user over a data network, with user commands for modifing the composition of subsequent image frames being received on a back-channel (26) of the network.",

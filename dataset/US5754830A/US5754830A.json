    "abstract": "A computer network environment (10) allowing connection of a client system (36) to a legacy host system (18,19) using a server (26) is provided. The computer network environment (10) includes a legacy host system (18,19) having TCP/IP connectivity. The legacy host system (18,19) is operable to support a terminal session for access to the legacy host system (18,19). The computer network environment (10) also includes a server system (24) executing a client thread (28) under a server (26). The client thread (28) is operable to communicate with the legacy host system (18,19) across a persistent TCP/IP socket connection (30). The computer network environment (10) further includes a client system (36) executing an applet process (42) under a web browser (38). The applet process (42) is operable to communicate with the client thread (28) across another persistent TCP/IP socket connection (44) and is operable to provide a terminal session to a user of the client system (36). This terminal session is supported by a persistent connection allowing real-time bidirectional communication with the legacy host system (18,19).",

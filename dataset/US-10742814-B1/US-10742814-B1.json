    "abstract": "Disclosed are various embodiments for routing communications to service agents based on a workflow. A computing device identifies a user intent object corresponding to a user interaction with the computing device. The computing device then generates a search criterion based on the identified user intent object and uses the search criterion for identifying the user intent in subsequent user interactions. After identifying the user intent, the computing device can identify a workflow corresponding to the user intent object. Later, the computing device can process one or more tasks associated with the workflow.",
    "claims": "\n1. A system, comprising:\na computing device comprising a processor and a memory; and\na first application comprising machine readable instructions stored in the memory that, when executed by the processor, cause the computing device to at least:\nidentify an association between a first text string in a first transcript and a user intent object based at least in part on an analysis of the first transcript, wherein the first transcript is generated from a first user conversation with a chat bot;\ngenerate a search criteria for the user intent object that includes the first text string;\ndetermine that a second text string in a second transcript matches the first text string specified by the search criteria, the second transcript being associated with a second user conversation with a second application;\nidentify a workflow item associated with the user intent object; and\nprocess the workflow item specified by the user intent object.\n2. The system of claim 1, wherein the search criteria comprises a plurality of text strings, and the first application further comprises machine readable instructions stored in the memory that, when executed by the processor, cause the computing device to at least:\nidentify a subset of the search criteria to use for searching for the user intent object in the second transcript based at least in part on clickstream data associated with a client device.\n3. The system of claim 2, wherein the clickstream data comprises a plurality of previous user interactions with a website by the client device.\n4. The system of claim 1, wherein processing the workflow item further comprises:\nidentifying a service agent for executing the workflow item based at least in part on the user intent object; and\nrouting a client device to the service agent.\n5. A system, comprising:\na computing device comprising a processor and a memory; and\nan application comprising machine readable instructions stored in the memory that, when executed by the processor, cause the computing device to at least:\ndetermine an association between a text string in a first transcript and a user intent object, wherein the first transcript was generated from a first user conversation with a chat bot;\ngenerate a search criteria for the user intent object that includes the text string;\nidentify the user intent object in a second transcript of a second user conversation with the chat bot based at least in part on applying the search criteria to the second transcript;\nselect a workflow item associated with the user intent object; and\nprocess the workflow item specified by the user intent object.\n6. The system of claim 5, wherein the application further comprises machine readable instructions stored in the memory that, when executed by the processor, cause the computing device to at least\ndetermine additional information to collect during the second user conversation based at least in part on the user intent object.\n7. The system of claim 5, wherein the search criteria comprises a plurality of text strings, and the application further comprises machine readable instructions stored in the memory that, when executed by the processor, cause the computing device to at least:\nidentify a subset of the search criteria to apply to the second transcript based at least in part on an interaction history of a client device of an user with a software application.\n8. The system of claim 5, wherein processing the workflow item comprises routing a service agent to a respective client device associated with an user, wherein the service agent is specified by the workflow item.\n9. The system of claim 5, wherein the workflow item further specifies a first portion of a workflow and a second portion of the workflow, the chat bot is designated to process the first portion of the workflow, and a human service agent designated to process the second portion of the workflow; and\nthe application further comprises machine readable instructions stored in the memory that, when executed by the processor, cause the computing device to at least:\ndetermine that the first portion of the workflow specified by the workflow item is complete; and\nroute a client device associated with the second user conversation from the chat bot to the human service agent specified by the workflow item in response to a determination that the first portion of the workflow is complete.\n10. The system of claim 5, wherein the second transcript of the second user conversation is generated from at least one of: a message application, a chat application, or an email application.\n11. The system of claim 5, wherein the user intent object is a first user intent object and the machine readable instructions that cause the computing device to identify the first user intent object in the second transcript further comprises machine readable instructions stored in the memory that, when executed by the processor, cause the computing device to at least:\nidentify a user interaction with a website by a client device;\ndetermine that the user interaction falls within a class of user interactions corresponding to the first user intent object; and\nidentify a second user intent object that is a child object of the first user intent object based at least in part on the search criteria being applied to the second transcript.\n12. The system of claim 5, wherein the search criteria comprises a regular expression.\n13. The system of claim 5, wherein the chat bot is configured to operate as a portion of an automated service agent.\n14. A method, comprising:\ndetermining, with a computing device, an association between a first text string in a first transcript and a user intent object, wherein the first transcript is generated from a first user conversation with a chat bot;\nstoring, with the computing device, the first text string as a search criterion for the user intent object;\nidentifying, with the computing device, the user intent object in a second transcript of a second user conversation with the chat bot based at least in part on applying the search criterion to the second transcript;\nselecting, with the computing device, a workflow item associated with the user intent object; and\nprocessing, with the computing device, the workflow item specified by associated with the user intent object.\n15. The method of claim 14, wherein processing the workflow item further comprises:\ncausing, with the computing device, the chat bot to request information associated with completing a task for the user intent object; and\nin response to receiving a user response from a client device, processing, with the computing device, the task with the user response.\n16. The method of claim 14, wherein the user intent object comprises a first user intent object, and processing the workflow item further comprises:\nrouting, with the computing device, a client device associated with the second user conversation to a first service agent capable of completing the workflow item; and\nidentifying, with the computing device, a change from the first user intent object to a second user intent object during a third user conversation with the first service agent.\n17. The method of claim 16, wherein the workflow item comprises a first workflow item, and the method further comprises:\nselecting a second workflow item associated with the second user intent object; and\nrouting the client device to a second service agent capable of completing the second workflow item.\n18. The method of claim 16, wherein identifying the change from the first user intent object to the second user intent object is based at least in part on clickstream data generated by the first service agent.\n19. The method of claim 14, wherein the search criterion comprises a plurality of pattern matching expressions.\n20. The method of claim 14, wherein identifying the user intent object in the second transcript of the second user conversation is further based at least in part on user interaction with a network page by a client device.",

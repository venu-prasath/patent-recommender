    "title": "Investment fund management method and system with dynamic risk adjusted allocation of assets",
    "abstract": "An invention for managing assets in one or more investment funds over a specified time. A fund comprises a plurality of assets (e.g., stocks bonds, currencies, gold, silver, oil, gas). A time horizon Ht representing the expected date at which cash will be withdrawn from the fund is associated with each fund. A time LH represents the length of time remaining between the present time and the horizon time Ht. A risk tolerance, RI, changes as a function of the decreasing time to horizon LH. Typically, the risk tolerance decreases as the fund approaches the time horizon Ht (e.g., investments become more conservative toward the end of the life of the fund). A strategic investment mix of assets in the fund is periodically determined as a function of the changing risk, RI. Investment modifications are accordingly made in the mix of assets in the fund. In one embodiment, a fund also includes a tactical investment strategy component (e.g., representing 25% of the overall investment strategy). The tactical investment strategy is based on the strategic investment mix. Typically, the percent of strategic investments directed to equity-type assets is used to define the percent of tactical investment that is directed to a first tactical investment allocation strategy. The remaining tactical investment amount is directed to a second tactical investment allocation strategy.",

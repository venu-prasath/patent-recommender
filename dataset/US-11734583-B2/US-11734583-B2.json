    "abstract": "A system, method and a computer program product may be provided for automatically creating and parameterizing a semantically-enriched diagnosis model for an entity. The system receives a list of data points, from sensors or a database, to be used to create a diagnosis model. The system automatically creates the diagnosis model based on the received list of data points and data stored in a database and parameterizes the diagnosis model. The parameterized diagnosis model reflects rules that determine one or more potential causes of one or more abnormalities of one or more physical conditions in the entity.",

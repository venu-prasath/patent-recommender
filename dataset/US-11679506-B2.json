    "abstract": "One embodiment of the present invention sets forth a technique for generating simulated training data for a physical process. The technique includes receiving, as input to at least one machine learning model, a first simulated image of a first object, wherein the at least one machine learning model includes mappings between simulated images generated from models of physical objects and real-world images of the physical objects. The technique also includes performing, by the at least one machine learning model, one or more operations on the first simulated image to generate a first augmented image of the first object. The technique further includes transmitting the first augmented image to a training pipeline for an additional machine learning model that controls a behavior of the physical process.",

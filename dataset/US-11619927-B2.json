    "abstract": "Efficient and effective workspace condition analysis systems and methods are presented. In one embodiment, a method comprises: accessing information associated with an activity space, including information on a newly discovered previously unmodeled entity; analyzing the activity information, including activity information associated with the previously unmodeled entity; forwarding feedback on the results of the analysis, including analysis results for the updated modeled information; and utilizing the feedback in a coordinated path plan check process. In one exemplary implementation the coordinated path plan check process comprises: creating a solid/CAD model including updated modeled information; simulating an activity including the updated modeled information; generating a coordinated path plan for entities in the activity space; and testing the coordinated path plan. The coordinated path plan check process can be a success. The analyzing can include automatic identification of potential collision points for a first actor, including potential collision points with the newly discovered object. The newly discovered previously unmodeled entity interferes with an actor from performing an activity. The newly discovered object is a portion of a tool component of a product.",

    "title": "Control system for gas turbine engine",
    "abstract": "A gas turbine engine control system is provided. In a preferred control system for use in combination with a helicopter, input signals respectively representative of power turbine speed error, power turbine shaft torque, and compressor shaft speed are employed. From these input signals, five intermediate signals are developed. One of the intermediate signals represents the main rotor speed error. Each of the five intermediate signals is provided with a separate predetermined gain and coupled to summation means. The predetermined gains are selected to be of values which reduce the effects of resonances provided by the mail and tail rotors of the helicopter. The output of the summation means represents a control signal and may be employed to operate a fuel control valve.",

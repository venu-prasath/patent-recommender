    "abstract": "An approach is provided for providing rule-based recommendations. The approach involves a processing of one or more user profile tags, context tags, content tags, channel tags and/or other context information. The approach further involves a determination of one or more weighting factors of one or more of the user profile tags, context tags, content tags, channel tags and other context information. The approach also involves an application of one or more rule sets that bases a determination of a recommendation on the weighting factor. The approach, then, generates one or more recommendations.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method comprising facilitating a processing of and/or processing (1) data and/or (2) information and/or (3) at least one signal, the (1) data and/or (2) information and/or (3) at least one signal based, at least in part, on the following:\na processing of context information associated with at least one user device,\nwherein the context information includes one or more user profile tags, context tags, content tags, channel tags, other context information or a combination thereof;\na determination of one or more weighting factors based, at least in part, on the context information;\nan application of one or more rule sets that bases a determination of a recommendation, at least in part, on the one or more weighting factors;\na processing of a determination to link two or more of the one or more rule sets to address two or more context scenarios associated with the context information; and\na generation of one or more recommendations based, at least in part, on the one or more rule sets.\n2. A method of claim 1, wherein the (1) data and/or (2) information and/or (3) at least one signal are further based, at least in part, on the following:\na processing of a determination of one or more context combinations of the two or more context scenarios; and\na generation of the at least one recommendation based on the linked rule sets and the determined combination of context scenarios.\n3. A method of claim 1, wherein the (1) data and/or (2) information and/or (3) at least one signal are further based, at least in part, on the following:\na processing of an addition, removal, modification, or combination thereof of the one or more rule sets by way of an administrative interface.\n4. A method of claim 1, wherein the (1) data and/or (2) information and/or (3) at least one signal are further based, at least in part, on the following:\nbuilding a user profile based on one or more interactions with the recommendation; and\na processing of a modification of the one or more weighting factors based on the user profile.\n5. A method of claim 1, wherein the (1) data and/or (2) information and/or (3) at least one signal are further based, at least in part, on the following:\na processing of a determination of the one or more weighting factors to be between 0 and 1, a multiplier, an addition, or a negative number.\n6. A method of claim 1, wherein the one or more rule sets defines a type of context and the one or more weighting factors to apply for generating the one or more recommendations.\n7. A method of claim 1, wherein the context tags are one or more of location specific tags provided by a location resolver, time specific tags provided by a time resolver, other context tags provided by context specific resolvers, and the user profile tags are provided by a profile engine.\n8. A method of claim 1, wherein the (1) data and/or (2) information and/or (3) at least one signal are further based, at least in part, on the following:\na determination of a limitation of a number of tags that are processed, the limitation being set by a user preference or a default value; and\na determination of tags having the most heavily weighted weighting factors that satisfy the limited number of tags,\nwherein the application of the one or more rule sets bases the determination of the one or more recommendations on the limited number of tags having the most heavily weighted weighting factors.\n9. A method of claim 1, wherein the (1) data and/or (2) information and/or (3) at least one signal are further based, at least in part, on the following:\na determination to query a recommendation engine for one or more recommendation tokens from a database.\n10. A method of claim 1, wherein the (1) data and/or (2) information and/or (3) at least one signal are further based, at least in part, on the following:\nan output of three sets of tags, each of which are context specific tags, profile specific tags or a combination of context and profile tags; and\nembedding the type of tags that are output in a response to a query.\n11. An apparatus comprising:\nat least one processor; and\nat least one memory including computer program code for one or more programs, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause the apparatus to perform at least the following:\nprocess and/or facilitate a processing of context information associated with at least one user device,\nwherein the context information includes one or more user profile tags, context tags, content tags, channel tags, other context information or a combination thereof;\ncause, at least in part, a determination of one or more weighting factors based, at least in part, on the context information,\ncause, at least in part, an application of one or more rule sets that bases a determination of a recommendation, at least in part, on the one or more weighting factors,\nprocess and/or facilitate a processing of a determination to link two or more of the one or more rule sets to address two or more context scenarios associated with the context information; and\ncause, at least in part, a generation of one or more recommendations based, at least in part, on the one or more rule sets.\n12. An apparatus of claim 11, wherein the apparatus is further caused to perform at least the following:\nprocess and/or facilitate a processing of a determination of one or more context combinations of the two or more context scenarios, and\ncause, at least in part, a generation of the at least one recommendation based on the linked rule sets and the determined combination of context scenarios.\n13. An apparatus of claim 11, wherein the apparatus is further caused to perform at least the following:\nprocess and/or facilitate a processing of an addition, removal, modification, or combination thereof of the one or more rule sets by way of an administrative interface.\n14. An apparatus of claim 11, wherein the apparatus is further caused to perform at least the following:\ncause, at least in part, building a user profile based on one or more interactions with the recommendation, and\nprocess and/or facilitate a processing of a modification of the one or more weighting factors based on the user profile.\n15. An apparatus of claim 11, wherein the apparatus is caused to perform at least the following:\nprocess and/or facilitate a processing of a determination of the one or more weighting factors to be between 0 and 1, a multiplier, an addition, or a negative number.\n16. An apparatus of claim 11, wherein the one or more rule sets defines a type of context and the one or more weighting factors to apply for generating the one or more recommendations.\n17. An apparatus of claim 11, wherein the context tags are one or more of location specific tags provided by a location resolver, time specific tags provided by a time resolver, other context tags provided by context specific resolvers, and the user profile tags are provided by a profile engine.\n18. An apparatus of claim 11, wherein the apparatus is further caused to perform at least the following:\ncause, at least in part, a determination of a limitation of a number of tags that are processed, the limitation being set by a user preference or a default value, and\ncause, at least in part, a determination of tags having the most heavily weighted weighting factors that satisfy the limited number of tags,\nwherein the application of the one or more rule sets bases the determination of the one or more recommendations on the limited number of tags having the most heavily weighted weighting factors.\n19. An apparatus of claim 11, wherein the apparatus is further caused to perform at least the following:\ncause, at least in part, a determination to query a recommendation engine for one or more recommendation tokens from a database.\n20. An apparatus of claim 11, wherein the apparatus is further caused to perform at least the following:\ncause, at least in part, an output of three sets of tags, each of which are context specific tags, profile specific tags or a combination of context and profile tags, and\ncause, at least in part, embedding the type of tags that are output in a response to a query."

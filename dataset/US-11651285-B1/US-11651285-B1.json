    "abstract": "Methods to infer user behavior are disclosed comprising a process of predefining one or more activities for a user application, providing a processor based device and user interface configured to operate with the device to support the user with tasks using the user application, the user application communicating an intent message to a transformative power management (TPM) application and the TPM configured to define and output an instruction for the application given the intention and the predefined activities. In some embodiments, the methods are implemented on a processor based device. In some embodiments, the systems and methods apply pattern recognition algorithms and pattern learning algorithms to manage the power allocation to power consuming devices.",

    "abstract": "A plurality of image processing engines are hosted within an image processing system. Each image processing engine performs one or more image processing operations or clinical content processing operations on medical images and clinical content. A user interface allows a user to configure the plurality of image processing engines for a particular study of images. The user interface allows the user to configure the plurality of image processing engines in any one of the following configurations: a series configuration where the image processing engines operate in series so that an output from one image processing engine serves as input to a next image processing engine; a parallel configuration where each image processing engine in the plurality of image processing engines operates without input from any other image processing engine in the plurality of image processing engines; or a a hybrid configuration where a first subset of image processing engines operate in a series configuration, and a second subset of image processing engines operate in a parallel configuration.",

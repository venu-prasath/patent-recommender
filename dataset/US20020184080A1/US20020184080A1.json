    "title": "Telecommunications system for generating a three-level customer behavior profile and for detecting deviation from the profile to identify fraud",
    "abstract": "Telecommunications apparatus and method for detecting any unusual activity in customer behavior. A comprehensive behavior profile of a customer is generated on the basis of customer transactions. The profile includes a short-term customer behavior obtained from all of the customer's transactions, and further includes a long-term customer behavior obtained on the basis of the generated short-term behavior. Any behavior deviation from the profile is detected and identified as fraudulent or unusual.",

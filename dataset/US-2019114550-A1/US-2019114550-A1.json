    "abstract": "Provided is a method for computer-implemented determination of a data-driven prediction model. The method processes digital input data having input and output variables and being semantically annotated based on a digital semantic representation having a hierarchical tree structure where each tree in the structure represents an input variable of the data, the leaf nodes of the respective tree being the discrete values of the input variable. The method of the embodiment provides a recoding of those discrete values by cutting off hierarchical levels of the respective trees. Based on this recoding, a plurality of data modifications is determined for the input data. Those data modifications are trained by a machine learning method where the trained machine learning method with the highest prediction quality is derived from the trained machine learning methods.",

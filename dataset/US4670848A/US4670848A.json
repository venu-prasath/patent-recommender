An artificial intelligence system in accordance with claim 1 wherein:\n(a) the statements are stored in the means for storing in the form of a list in the order of their input; and\n(b) the means for matching matches the list of statements with the sets of patterns in a last in first out order.\n5. An artificial intelligence system in accordance with claim 2 wherein:\n(a) the statements are stored in the means for storing in the form of a list in the order of their input; and\n(b) the means for matching matches the list of statements with the sets of patterns in a last in first out order.\n6. An artificial intelligence system in accordance with claim 3 wherein:\n(a) the statements are stored in the means for storing in the form of a list in the order of their input; and\n(b) the means for matching matches the list of statements with the sets of patterns in a last in first out order.\n7. An artificial intelligence system in accordance with claim 4 wherein:\n(a) the statements are stored in the means for storing in the form of a list in the order of their input; and\n(b) the means for matching matches the list of statements with the sets of patterns in a last in first out order.\n8. An artificial intelligence system in accordance with claim 2 wherein a new concept may be assumed by default when no match occurs to identify a new concept.\n9. An artificial intelligence system for accepting a natural language statement, understanding the meaning of the natural language statement and making a response to the natural language statement based upon at least a partial understanding of the natural language statement comprising:\n(a) an input means for providing an initial natural language statement and additional natural language statements which provide information for determining the final meaning of the initial natural language statement;\n(b) an output means for providing any response to the initial natural language statement and any inquiries requesting additional natural language statements to be inputted on the input means;\n(c) a knowledge base having a plurality of addressable nodes, each node representing a current concept of the initial natural language statement and having stored thereat either zero patterns or, if any, at least two sets of patterns with each set of patterns identifying a distinct new node within the knowledge base where a new concept of the initial natural language statement is represented and, optionally, a response based upon at least a partial understanding of the initial natural language statement and the new concept of the initial natural language statement augmenting the current and previous concepts and additionally optionally identifying a final concept;\n(d) means for storing the initial natural language statement and each additional natural language statement and any sets of patterns fetched from the node of the knowledge base associated with the current concept;\n(e) means for matching the initial natural language statement and each additional natural language statement which has been inputted by the input means with sets of patterns which are stored from the node associated with the current concept to determine when a match uccurs between any one of the stored natural language statements and any one of the patterns within the stored sets of patterns for identifying the new concept associated with the matched pattern; and\n(f) a control means for controlling the inputting of natural language statements, the outputting of any response to the initial natural language statement and any inquiries requesting the input of additional natural language statements, the storage of the natural language statements and patterns fetched from the node associated with the current concept by the storage means, the transmission of the natural language statements and any patterns from the node associated with the current concept from the storage means to the means for matching and the transmission of an identification of the new node to the knowledge base.\n10. An artificial intelligence system in accordance with claim 9 wherein:\n(a) the means for matching also determines if no match exists between the natural language statements and any of the patterns of the sets of patterns stored at the node associated with the current concept;\n(b) the means for storing also stores from the node associated with the current concept additional natural language information to be outputted by the output means as a natural language inquiry for additional natural language statements to be inputted by the input means; and\n(c) the control means causes the outputting of the natural language inquiry when no match is determined.\n11. An artificial intelligence system in accordance with claim 9 wherein:\n(a) each node of the knowledge base may also store additional natural language information distinct from any natural language responses or natural language inquiries; and\n(b) the control means causes the additional natural language information to be outputted by the output means in conjunction with the inputting of request for assistance in response to a natural language inquiry.\n12.

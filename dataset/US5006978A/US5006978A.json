    "title": "Relational database system having a network for transmitting colliding packets and a plurality of processors each storing a disjoint portion of database",
    "abstract": "A multiprocessor system intercouples the processors with an active logic network having a plurality of priority determining nodes. Messages applied concurrently to the network in groups are sorted, using the data content of the messages, to a single or common priority message which is distributed to all the processors with a predetermined total network delay time. Losing messages are again retried concurrently in groups at a later time. Message routing is determined by local acceptance or rejection of messages at the processors, based upon destination data in the messages. All messages occupy places in a coherent priority scheme and are transferred in contending groups with prioritization on the network. Using data, status, control and response messages, and different multiprocessor modes, the system is particularly suited for configuration in a relational data base machine having capability for maintaining an extended data base and handling complex queries.",

    "title": "Toll fraud detection system",
    "abstract": "In a telecommunications network, a toll fraud detection system analyzes call placement information concerning toll calls placed using billing numbers for unauthorized use of billing numbers. In the preferred embodiment, a set of artificial intelligence rules operate on the placement information to develop an indication that the use of a particular billing number is unauthorized.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for detecting fraudulent calls in a telecommunications network wherein the network is operable for handling calls from origination telephone numbers to termination telephone numbers using billing numbers, the method comprising:\nreceiving call information into a computer system wherein the call information comprises at least an origination number, a termination number, and a billing number for a particular call;\nstoring history information in the computer system wherein the history information is related to previous fraudulent calls and comprises a least the origination numbers, the destination numbers, and the billing numbers for the previous fraudulent calls;\nanalyzing the call information and the history information in the computer system according to a set of rules to develop a priority indicating a likelihood that the billing number for the particular call has been fraudulently used, wherein the set of rules comprises comparing the origination number, the termination number, and the billing number for the particular call to the originating numbers, the terminating numbers, and the billing numbers of the previous fraudulent calls.\n2. The method of claim 1, further including the step of indexing the history information by originating number, by terminating number, and by billing number.\n3. The method of claim 1 further comprising updating the history information with information from subsequent fraudulent calls.\n4. The method of claim 1 wherein the set of rules further comprises comparing the duration of the particular call to a pre-determined time period.\n5. The method of claim 1 wherein the set of rules further comprises determining if the billing number of the particular call is being used simultaneously.\n6. The method of claim 1 wherein the set of rules further comprises comparing the number of calls using the billing number of the particular call over a time period to a threshold number of calls for the time period.\n7. The method of claim 1 further comprising generating a report in response to an indication wherein the report incorporates the call information and history information associated with the call information.\n8. A method for detecting fraudulent calls in a telecommunications network wherein the network is operable for handling calls from origination telephone numbers to termination telephone numbers using billing numbers, the method comprising:\nreceiving call information into a computer system wherein the call information comprises at least an origination number, a termination number, and a billing number for a particular call;\nstoring history information related to previous fraudulent calls in the computer system;\nanalyzing the call information and the history information in the computer system according to a set of rules derived from previous fraudulent calls to develop a priority indicating a likelihood that the particular call was fraudulent.\n9. A system for detecting fraudulent calls in a telecommunications network wherein the network is operable for handling calls from origination telephone numbers to termination telephone numbers using the billing numbers, the system comprising:\na first computer means for receiving call information that comprises at least an origination number, a termination number, and a billing number for a particular call;\na second computer means for storing history information that is related to previous fraudulent calls;\na third computer means associated with the first and second computer means for analyzing the call information and the history information according to a set of rules derived from previous fraudulent usage to develop a priority indicating a likelihood that the particular call is fraudulent.\n10. The system of claim 9 wherein the second computer means is for storing at least originating numbers, terminating numbers, and billing numbers for previous fraudulent calls.\n11. The system of claim 9 wherein the third computer means is for comparing the duration of the particular call to a pre-determined time period.\n12. The system of claim 9 wherein the third computer means is for comparing the number of calls using the billing number of the particular call over a time period to a threshold number of calls for the time period.\n13. The system of claim 9 wherein the third computer means is for generating a report in response to an indication wherein the report incorporates the call information and history information associated with the call information.\n14. A method for detecting fraudulent calls in a telecommunications network wherein the network is operable for handling calls from origination telephone numbers to termination telephone numbers using billing numbers, the method comprising:\nreceiving call information into a computer system wherein the call information comprises at least an origination number, a termination number, and a billing number for a particular call;\nstoring history information in the computer system wherein the history information is related to previous fraudulent calls and comprises a least the origination numbers, the destination numbers, and the billing numbers for the previous fraudulent calls;\nanalyzing the call information and the history information in the computer system according to a set of rules to develop an indication that the billing number for the particular call has been fraudulently used, wherein the set of rules comprises determining if the billing number of the particular call is being used simultaneously and comparing the origination number, the termination number, and the billing number for the particular call to the originating numbers, the terminating numbers, and the billing numbers of the previous fraudulent calls.\n15. A system for detecting fraudulent calls in a telecommunications network wherein the network is operable for handling calls from origination telephone numbers to termination telephone numbers using the billing numbers, the system comprising:\na first computer means for receiving call information that comprises at least an origination number, a termination number, and a billing number for a particular call;\na second computer means for storing history information that is related to previous fraudulent calls;\na third computer means associated with the first and second computer means for determining if the billing number for the particular call is being used simultaneously and for analyzing the call information and the history information according to a set of rules derived from previous fraudulent usage to develop a priority indicating a likelihood that the particular call is fraudulent.",

    "abstract": "An approach is provided for domain-specific chatbots that employ distributed natural language classifiers (NLCs). A NLC included in a first chatbot is executed, which generates a first intent of a question and a first confidence that the first intent is an actual intent of the question. Based on a determination that the first confidence does not exceed a threshold, the question is broadcasted to other chatbots. A second confidence that a second intent is an actual intent is received from a second chatbot in response to the broadcast, and is determined to exceed the threshold. An association among the question, the second chatbot, the second confidence, and the second intent is stored in a memory cache included in the first chatbot. A response to the question is generated based on the second intent. The response is presented to a user from the first chatbot.",

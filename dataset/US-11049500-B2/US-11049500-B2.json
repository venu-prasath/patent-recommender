    "abstract": "Systems and methods for generating responses to user input such as dialogues, and images are discussed. The system may generate, by a response generation module of at least one server, an optimal generated response to the user communication by applying an generative adversarial network. In some embodiments, the generative adversarial network may include a hierarchical recurrent encoder decoder generative adversarial network including a generator and a discriminator component.",

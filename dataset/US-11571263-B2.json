The method of claim 6, wherein the region of interest is a center region of the glenoid or a center region of the humeral head.\n8. The method of claim 6, wherein receiving the user input comprises one or more of:\nreceiving motion data from one or more sensors of a visualization device;\nreceiving audio data indicating one or more voice commands; and\nreceiving data indicating the performance of one or more hand gestures.\n9. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\ndisplaying, via a visualization device and overlaid on the portion of the bone viewable via the visualization device, the virtual model of the portion of the bone.\n10. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\ndisplaying, via a visualization device and overlaid on the portion of the bone, a virtual guide that guides at least one of preparation of the bone for attachment of the prosthetic or attachment of the prosthetic to the bone.\n11. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nin response to determining that registration can be maintained without the physical marker remaining present outputting an indication that the physical marker may be removed.\n12. The method of claim 1, wherein the physical marker is a first physical marker, the method further comprising:\nobtaining, a virtual model of an instrument;\nidentifying, based on data obtained by the one or more optical sensors, respective positions of markers on a plurality of faces of a second physical marker positioned relative to the instrument; and\nregistering, based on the identified positions of the markers on the plurality of faces of the second physical marker, the virtual model of the instrument with a corresponding observed portion of the instrument.\n13. The method of claim 12, wherein registering the virtual model with the observed portion comprises:\nperiodically registering the virtual model with the observed portion.\n14. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\ndetermining a confidence of the registration of the virtual model by at least determining a confidence distance that represents a maximum distance between a point on the virtual model and a corresponding point on the observed portion of the bone.\n15.

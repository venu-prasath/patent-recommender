    "abstract": "Feature-based prediction is described. In an example, a vehicle can capture sensor data while traversing an environment and can provide the sensor data to computing system(s). The sensor data can indicate event(s), such as a lane change, associated with agent(s) in the environment. The computing system(s) can determine, based on the sensor data, a time associated with the event and can determine features associated with a period of time relative to the time of the event. In an example, the computing system(s) can aggregate the features with additional features associated with other similar events to generate training data and can train, based at least in part on the training data, a machine learned model for predicting new events. In an example, the machine learned model can be transmitted to vehicle(s), which can be configured to alter drive operation(s) based, at least partly, on output(s) of the machine learned model.",

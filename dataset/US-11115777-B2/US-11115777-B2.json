    "abstract": "A method for providing incentives based on geolocation of mobile devices. The method includes storing, by a server, data including merchant information of merchants and points of interest, and associated incentive information. The method includes determining, based on communication with user's device of a user, a first location of the mobile device. The method includes determining, based on the first location, a first subset of merchants and associated first subset of incentives. The method includes communicating merchant data, including information on the first subsets of merchants and incentives, to the mobile device. The method includes communicating to the mobile device, in response to a determination that the mobile device is inside a geofence associated with at least one of the first subset of merchants, additional information on the at least one of the first subset of merchants, the additional information comprising one or more related incentives.",

A method for providing location-based incentives to mobile devices, the method comprising:\nreceiving, at a server and from a mobile device, a first communication indicating a first location of the mobile device of a user;\nidentifying a first subset of merchants located in an area proximate to the first location, the first subset of merchants selected from a plurality of merchants based, at least in part, on the area, wherein the plurality of merchants is associated with a plurality of incentives;\ntransmitting, to the mobile device, merchant data indicating at least the first subset of merchants and information describing the first subset of merchants;\ndetermining, based on a second communication from the mobile device, that the mobile device has crossed a first geofence associated with at least one of the first subset of merchants; and\nresponsive to determining that the mobile device crossed the first geofence, transmitting additional information describing the at least one of the first subset of merchants to the mobile device, the additional information further comprising one or more incentives, of the plurality of incentives, related to the at least one of the first subset of merchants.\n9. The method of claim 8, wherein said transmitting the additional information comprises triggering a notification on the mobile device indicating that the mobile device is proximate to the at least one of the first subset of merchants.\n10. The method of claim 9, wherein said triggering the notification comprises effecting the mobile device to display, on a software user interface of the mobile device, a visual indication that the mobile device is proximate to the at least one of the first subset of merchants.\n11. The method of claim 9, wherein the notification comprises an alarm for displaying on a software user interface of the mobile device, the alarm indicating the one or more incentives related to the at least one of the first subset of merchants.\n12. The method of claim 8, further comprising;\naccessing location and incentive data indicating:\na respective location of each of the plurality of merchants, and\na respective incentive for each of the plurality of merchants, wherein said identifying the first subset of merchants is further based on the location and incentive data.\n13. The method of claim 8, further comprising:\ndetermining the first geofence based on the area proximate to the first location.\n14. The method of claim 8, wherein a plurality of geofences are associated with the area proximate to the first location, the plurality of geofences comprising the first geofence.\n15. The method of claim 8, further comprising:\naggregating data from the mobile device; and\ntransmitting the aggregated data to a third-party system for analysis, wherein the one or more incentives are received from the third-party system based on the analysis.\n16. The method of claim 8, wherein the additional information comprises one or more images for display on a user interface of the mobile device, the one or more images associated with the at least one of the first subset of merchants.\n17. The method of claim 8, wherein the merchant data comprises one or more images for display on a user interface of the mobile device, the one or more images associated with the first subset of merchants.\n18. The method of claim 8, further comprising:\nsending an email to an email address of the user, the email based on analysis of a behavior of the user, the email comprising at least a portion of the additional information describing the at least one of the first subset of merchants.\n19. A non-transitory machine-readable medium having instructions stored thereon, the instructions executable to cause performance of operations comprising:\nreceiving, at a server, a first communication from a mobile device of a user, the first communication indicating a first location of the mobile device;\ndetermining, at the server, first merchants proximate to the first location, the first merchants selected from a plurality of merchants based, at least in part, on the first location, wherein the plurality of merchants is associated with a plurality of incentives accessible by the server;\ncommunicating, to the mobile device, merchant data indicating at least the first merchants and first details describing the first merchants, the first details including first incentives of the plurality of incentives related to the first merchants;\ndetermining, based on a second communication from the mobile device, that the mobile device has crossed into a first geofence associated with at least one merchant of the first merchants; and\nresponsive to determining that the mobile device crossed into the first geofence, communicating, by the server and to the mobile device, additional merchant data including additional details describing the at least one merchant, the additional details comprising one or more second incentives, of the plurality of incentives, related to the at least one merchant.\n20.

    "abstract": "A system and corresponding method are provided for generating responses for a dialogue between a user and a computer. The system includes a memory storing information for a dialogue history and a knowledge base. An encoder may receive a new utterance from the user and generate a global memory pointer used for filtering the knowledge base information in the memory. A decoder may generate at least one local memory pointer and a sketch response for the new utterance. The sketch response includes at least one sketch tag to be replaced by knowledge base information from the memory. The system generates the dialogue computer response using the local memory pointer to select a word from the filtered knowledge base information to replace the at least one sketch tag in the sketch response.",

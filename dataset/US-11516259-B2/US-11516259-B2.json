Embodiments of the identity management systems disclosed herein may utilize a network graph approach to analyzing roles of a distributed networked enterprise computing environment. Specifically, in certain embodiments, an artificial intelligence based identity management systems may utilize role graphs to assess the role structure of a distributed enterprise computing environment.",
    "claims": "\n1. An identity management system, comprising:\na data store;\na processor;\na non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium, including computer instructions for:\n2. The system of claim 1, wherein a type of the role graph is selected by a user through the interface.\n3. The system of claim 2, wherein the type comprises a first type where each edge is an access similarity relationship or a second type where each edge is a concurrency similarity relationship.\n4. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions are further for receiving a selection of the health metric, where in the determination and presentation of the health metric is in response to the reception of the selection of the health metric.\n5. The system of claim 1, wherein the presentation of the role graph includes a visual indicator comprising the presentation of the health metric.\n6. The system of claim 1, wherein the health metric for the set of roles associated with the distributed enterprise computing environment measures a deviation from a second role graph.\n7. The system of claim 1, wherein the health metric is based on a number of identities or entitlements associated with one or more roles represented in the role graph.\n8. A method, comprising:\nobtaining identity management data from one or more identity management systems in a distributed enterprise computing environment over one or more computer network connections, the identity management data comprising data on a set of roles, a set of entitlements, and a set of identities, the set of roles, set of entitlements and set of identities utilized in identity management in the distributed enterprise computing environment;\nevaluating the identity management data to determine the set of roles, identities of the set of identities associated with the set of roles, and entitlements of the set of entitlements associated with the set of roles;\ngenerating a role graph from the identity management data by:\ncreating a node of the role graph for each of the determined set of roles, for each first identity and second identity that share at least one entitlement of the set of entitlements or at least one identity of the set of identities, creating an edge of the role graph between a first node representing a first role and a second node of the role graph representing a second role, and\ngenerating a weight for each edge of the role graph between each first node representing the first role and second node representing the second role based on the at least one entitlement or the at least one identity shared between the first role represented by the first node and the second role represented by the second node;\nstoring the role graph in the data store;\ndetermining a health metric for one or more of the set of roles associated with the distributed enterprise computing environment based on the role graph; and\npresenting the health metric and the role graph to a user through an interface.\n9. The method of claim 8, wherein a type of the role graph is selected by a user through the interface.\n10. The method of claim 9, wherein the type comprises a first type where each edge is an access similarity relationship or a second type where each edge is a concurrency similarity relationship.\n11.

The method of claim 8, wherein the health metric for the set of roles associated with the distributed enterprise computing environment measures a deviation from a second role graph.\n14. The method of claim 8, wherein the health metric is based on a number of identities or entitlements associated with one or more roles represented in the role graph.\n15. A non-transitory computer readable medium, comprising computer instructions that, when executed on a processor, cause the processor to perform the steps of:\nobtaining identity management data from one or more identity management systems in a distributed enterprise computing environment, the identity management data comprising data on a set of roles, a set of entitlements, and a set of identities, the set of roles, set of entitlements and set of identities utilized in identity management in the distributed enterprise computing environment;\nevaluating the identity management data to determine the set of roles, identities of the set of identities associated with the set of roles, and entitlements of the set of entitlements associated with the set of roles;\ngenerating a role graph from the identity management data by:\ncreating a node of the role graph for each of the determined set of roles, for each first identity and second identity that share at least one entitlement of the set of entitlements or at least one identity of the set of identities, creating an edge of the role graph between a first node representing a first role and a second node of the role graph representing a second role, and\ngenerating a weight for each edge of the role graph between each first node representing the first role and second node representing the second role based on the at least one entitlement or the at least one identity shared between the first role represented by the first node and the second role represented by the second node;\nstoring the role graph in the data store;\ndetermining a health metric for one or more of the set of roles associated with the distributed enterprise computing environment based on the role graph; and\npresenting the health metric and the role graph to a user through an interface.\n16. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, wherein a type of the role graph is selected by a user through the interface.\n17. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, wherein the type comprises a first type where each edge is an access similarity relationship or a second type where each edge is a concurrency similarity relationship.\n18. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, wherein the instructions are further for receiving a selection of the health metric, where in the determination and presentation of the health metric is in response to the reception of the selection of the health metric.\n19. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, wherein the presentation of the role graph includes a visual indicator comprising the presentation of the health metric.\n20. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, wherein the health metric for the set of roles associated with the distributed enterprise computing environment measures a deviation from a second role graph.\n21. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, wherein the health metric is based on a number of identities or entitlements associated with one or more roles represented in the role graph.",

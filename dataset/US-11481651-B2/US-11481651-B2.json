    "abstract": "A method and apparatus for certification of facts introduces a certifier and a fact certificate into the fact-exchange cycle that enables parties to exchange trustworthy facts. Certification is provided to a fact presenter during the first part of the fact-exchange cycle, and verification is provided to the fact receiver during the last part of the cycle. To request a certification, a fact presenter presents the Certifier with a fact. In return, the certifier issues a fact certificate, after which the fact presenter presents the fact certificate to the fact receiver instead of presenting the fact itself. The receiver inspects the received certificate in order to evaluate the fact's validity and trustworthiness. For some facts and notions of verification, the certificate is sufficient and its inspection does not require any communication. For others, the receiver requests a verification service from the Certifier in order to complete the verification.",
    "claims": "\n1. A computer-implemented method for exchange of verifiable digital information, using a fact certification module and a fact verification module, the fact certification module and fact verification module each comprising a processor, a communication interface, and wherein the fact certification module and the fact verification module each have access to a permanent storage system,\nwherein during a fact certification stage, the fact certification module performs the method comprising:\nreceiving a digital fact for certification at the fact certification module from a fact presenter via the communication interface;\nissuing a digital certification data structure corresponding to the digital fact received for certification, wherein validity of the digital fact received for certification is verifiable by a receiver of the digital certification data structure;\narchiving the digital certification data structure in a permanent storage system; and\nwherein, during a fact verification stage, the fact verification module performs the method comprising:\nreceiving a verification request at the fact verification module from a fact receiver via the communication interface, the request including any of a digital fact of interest, a digital digest of the fact of interest, or a unique fact identifier corresponding to the fact of interest;\naccessing a permanent storage system; and\nreturning to the fact receiver via the communication interface a response to the received verification request, the response comprising any of:\na search result,\na digital certification data structure retrieved from the permanent storage system, and\na formatted response data structure; and\nwherein a witness certifier system performs the method comprising:\nmaintaining a registry of witnesses, wherein an interested witness registers to be notified of all observed facts certified by the fact certification module or specifies a filter or condition that triggers a notification of an observed fact, said fact certification module including a digest of the fact and/or a list of all notified witnesses in said notification.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein said digital fact attests to change or transfer of ownership of a physical or digital asset from one person or entity to another person or entity.\n3. The method of the claim 2, wherein identity of the asset and/or the identity of an original owner and/or the identity of a new owner is not disclosed in the digital fact or digital certification data structure.\n4. The method of the claim 1, wherein said digital fact concerns an asset comprising a digital asset, said digital asset comprising any of a digital file, a digital photograph, a digital video, a digital character, and an item in a multiplayer computer game.\n5. The method of claim 1, said digital certification data structure further comprising:\ninformation and/or machine-readable code with which a computer program automatically verifies said digital fact.\n6. The method of claim 1, said digital fact further comprising:\nmachine-readable code that executes under machine-readable conditions specified in said digital fact.\n7. The method of claim 1, said digital certification data structure comprising:\na cryptographically secure digest of observed information.\n8. The method of claim 1, wherein final receivers of the fact being certified are not known in advance and may not trust the fact certification module;\nfurther comprising:\none or more of said witnesses registering additional witnesses;\nupon certification of an observed fact, said certification module communicating a secure digest of the fact to all registered witnesses; and\nsaid registered witnesses then communicating the secure fact further;\nwherein a time-stamped secure digest of the fact is broadcast to a network of witnesses.\n9. The method of claim 1, wherein said formatted response data structure comprises:\na result certificate.\n10. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nduring a fact presentation stage, including a unique fact code with a presentation of a fact certified during the fact certification stage; and\nany fact receiver having access to said presentation using said fact code to issue a verification request as part of a fact certification stage.\n11. The method of claim 10, wherein the unique fact code is machine-readable and/or human-readable, said fact code comprising any of a unique fact identifier, a universal fact address, and a digital fact digest.\n12. The method of claim 10, wherein the presentation of a certified fact comprises a visually-recognizable symbol for human readers which confirms that the fact certification stage has been performed and that a fact verification stage is available.\n13. A computer-implemented method for exchange of verifiable digital information, using a fact certification module, and a permanent storage system, the fact certification module comprising a processor and a communication interface, wherein during a fact certification stage, the fact certification module performing the method comprising:\nreceiving a digital fact for certification at the fact certification module from a fact presenter via the communication interface;\nissuing a digital certification data structure corresponding to the digital fact received for certification, wherein validity of the digital fact received for certification is verifiable by a receiver of the digital certification data structure;\narchiving the digital certification data structure in the permanent storage system; and\nwherein, during a fact verification stage, the receiver performs the method comprising:\nsending a verification request to a fact verification module via the communication interface, the request including any of a digital fact of interest, a digital digest of the fact of interest, or a unique fact identifier corresponding to the fact of interest; and\nreceiving from the fact verification module via the communication interface a response to the verification request, the response comprising at least one of:\na search result,\na digital certification data structure retrieved from the permanent storage system, or\na formatted response data structure; and\nwherein a witness certifier system performs the method comprising:\nmaintaining a registry of witnesses, wherein an interested witness registers to be notified of all observed facts certified by the fact certification module or specifies a filter or condition that triggers a notification of an observed fact, said fact certification module including a digest of the fact and/or a list of all notified witnesses in said notification.\n14. The method of claim 13, further comprising:\npublishing, via the communication interface, any of the digital fact received for certification or a digital digest of the digital fact received for certification.\n15. The method of claim 13, further comprising:\ntransmitting any of the digital certification data structure or a digital digest thereof to the fact presenter via the communication interface.\n16. A computer-implemented method for exchange of verifiable digital information, using a fact verification module, and a permanent storage system, the fact verification module comprising a processor and a communication interface, wherein, during a fact verification stage, the fact verification module performs the method comprising:\nreceiving a verification request at the fact verification module from a fact receiver via the communication interface, the request including any of a digital fact of interest, a digital digest of the fact of interest, or a unique fact identifier corresponding to the fact of interest;\naccessing said permanent storage system; and\nreturning to the fact receiver via the communication interface a response to the received verification request, the response comprising any of:\na search result,\na digital certification data structure retrieved from the permanent storage system, and\na formatted response data structure;\nwherein the digital fact is received for certification at a fact certification module from a fact presenter via the communication interface;\nwherein during a fact certification stage, the fact certification module performs the method comprising:\nissuing a digital certification data structure corresponding to the digital fact, wherein validity of the digital fact is verifiable by the receiver;\narchiving the digital certification data structure in the permanent storage system; and\nwherein a witness certifier system performs the method comprising:\nmaintaining a registry of witnesses, wherein an interested witness registers to be notified of all observed facts certified by the fact certification module or specifies a filter or condition that triggers a notification of an observed fact, said fact certification module including a digest of the fact and/or a list of all notified witnesses in said notification.",

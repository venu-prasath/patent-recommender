    "abstract": "A system for an artificial intelligence alimentary professional support network for vibrant constitutional guidance includes a computing device. The system includes a diagnostic engine designed and configured to receive a biological extraction from a user and generate a diagnostic output based on the biological extraction. The system includes an advisor module designed and configured to receive a request for an advisory input, generate an advisory output using the request for an advisory input and the diagnostic output, and transmit the advisory output. The system includes an alimentary input module designed and configured to receive the advisory output, select an informed advisor alimentary professional client device as a function of the request for an advisory input, and transmit the at least an advisory output to the informed advisor alimentary professional client device.",
    "claims": "\n1. A system for an artificial intelligence alimentary professional support network for vibrant constitutional guidance, the system comprising:\na computing device;\nat least a diagnostic engine operating on the computing device, the at least a diagnostic engine designed and configured to:\nreceive a first training data set including a plurality of first data entries, each first data entry of the plurality of first data entries including at least an element of physiological state data and at least a correlated first prognostic label;\nreceive a second training data set including a plurality of second data entries, each second data entry of the plurality of second data entries including at least a second prognostic label and at least a correlated ameliorative process label;\ntrain, iteratively, a first machine-learning model using the first training data set and a first machine-learning process;\ntrain, iteratively, a second machine-learning model using the second training data set and a second machine-learning process;\nreceive at least a biological extraction from a user; and\ngenerate a diagnostic output based on the at least a biological extraction and the first machine-learning model, wherein the first machine-learning model uses the at least a biological extraction as an input to output the diagnostic output;\nan advisory module designed and configured to:\ndetect a nutritional advisory intervention event as a function of the diagnostic output;\ngenerate a response to the advisory intervention event wherein the response identifies an advisory action; and\ntransmit the response to a user client device.\n2. The system of claim 1, wherein the computing device further comprises:\nan alimentary input module designed and configured to:\nreceive the nutritional advisory intervention event; and\nselect at least an informed advisor client device as a function of the nutritional advisory intervention event.\n3. The system of claim 2, wherein the alimentary input module selects the at least an informed advisor client device as a function of the at least a biological extraction.\n4. The system of claim 1, wherein the advisory action comprises instructions for a diet.\n5. The system of claim 1, wherein the advisory module is further configured to detect the nutritional advisory intervention event as a function of an input from the user client device.\n6. The system of claim 1, wherein the advisory module is further configured to detect the nutritional advisory intervention event utilizing a user-specific learner.\n7. The system of claim 6, the user-specific learner is further configured to:\nreceive a plurality of nutritional inputs identifying user nutritional behavior;\nidentify a nutritional behavior outlier; and\ninitiate a consultation event with a nutritional informed advisor.\n8. The system of 1, wherein the advisory module is further configured to generate the advisory action adjusting a comprehensive instruction set.\n9. The system of claim 1, wherein the advisory module is further configured to generate the advisory action containing a textual output.\n10. The system of claim 1, wherein the advisory module is further configured to:\ngenerate the response to contain an urgency label;\nlocate an emergency nutritional informed advisor; and\ntransmit the response to an advisor client device operated by the emergency nutritional informed advisor.\n11. A method of an artificial intelligence alimentary professional support network for vibrant constitutional guidance, the method comprising:\nreceiving by a computing device a first training data set including a plurality of first data entries, each first data entry of the plurality of first data entries including at least an element of physiological state data and at least a correlated first prognostic label;\nreceiving by the computing device a second training data set including a plurality of second data entries, each second data entry of the plurality of second data entries including at least a second prognostic label and at least a correlated ameliorative process label;\ntrain, iteratively, a first machine-learning model using the first training data set and a first machine-learning process;\ntrain, iteratively, a second machine-learning model using the second training data set and a second machine-learning process;\nreceiving by the computing device at least a biological extraction from a user;\ngenerating by the computing device a diagnostic output based the at least a biological extraction and the first machine-learning model, wherein the first machine-learning model uses the at least a biological extraction as an input to output the diagnostic output;\ndetecting by the computing device a nutritional advisory intervention event as a function of the diagnostic output;\ngenerating by the computing device a response to the advisory intervention event wherein the response identifies an advisory action; and\ntransmitting by the computing device the response to a user client device.\n12. The method of claim 11, further comprising:\nreceiving the nutritional advisory intervention event; and\nselecting at least an informed advisor client device as a function of the nutritional advisory intervention event.\n13. The method of claim 12, wherein the at least an informed advisor client device is selected as a function of the at least a biological extraction.\n14. The method of claim 11, wherein the advisory action comprises instructions for a diet.\n15. The method of claim 11, wherein the computing device detects the nutritional advisory intervention event as a function of an input from a user client device.\n16. The method of claim 11, wherein the computing device detects the nutritional advisory intervention event utilizing a user-specific learner.\n17. The method of claim 16 further comprising:\nreceiving a plurality of nutritional inputs identifying user nutritional behavior;\nidentifying a nutritional behavior outlier; and\ninitiating a consultation event with a nutritional informed advisor.\n18. The method of 11, wherein generating the advisory action further comprises adjusting a comprehensive instruction set.\n19. The method of claim 11, wherein generating the advisory action further comprises generating a textual output.\n20. The method of claim 11 further comprising:\ngenerating the response to contain an urgency label;\nlocating an emergency nutritional informed advisor; and\ntransmitting the response to an advisor client device operated by the emergency nutritional informed advisor.",

    "title": "Automated system for providing liquidity to securities markets",
    "abstract": "An automated system for managing one or more large investor portfolios containing both cash and numerous, diversified securities in a real time environment provides added liquidity to the securities markets while maintaining predetermined portfolio objectives for each portfolio. The disclosed system uses data processing equipment to place buy and sell orders on securities markets and with automated brokers to execute trade directly between users of the system and external markets. Holders of such large, diversified portfolios have usually been long-term investors. The system allows active market participation by such investors whereby they provide added liquidity and depth to the securities markets while overcoming problems caused by trader identification and the inability to enter, change or execute orders in a real time environment. The system monitors and analyzes a variety of factors which effect trading decisions in a vast number of securities. Such factors include other security trades, price and size quotations and financial ratios for particular securities. This information is further analyzed in relationship to each investor portfolio using the system to determine what transactions might benefit the portfolio by seeking to provide an incremental return while accommodating the basic portfolio objectives. These objectives may be changed at the election of the investor at any time. Orders representing such transactions are entered by the system and executed in real time either internally between system users or externally with computerized brokers and/or stock exchanges and markets.",

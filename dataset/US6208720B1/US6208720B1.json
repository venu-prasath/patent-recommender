    "title": "System, method and computer program product for a dynamic rules-based threshold engine",
    "abstract": "A configurable and scalable rules-based thresholding system, method and computer program product for processing event records includes a core infrastructure and a configurable domain-specific implementation. The core infrastructure is generically employed regardless of the actual type of network being monitored. The domain-specific implementation is provided with user specific data and rules. The core infrastructure includes an event record enhancer which enhances events with additional data and a threshold detector which determines whether an enhanced event record, alone or in light of prior event records, exceeds one or more thresholds. The enhancer can access external databases for additional information related to an event record. In one embodiment, the enhancer generates feature vectors to represent enhanced event records. The threshold detector receives enhanced event records from the event record enhancer. The threshold detector selects one or more threshold rules from a database of threshold rules for applying to the enhanced event records. Where enhanced event records are in the form of feature vectors containing features and feature values, the threshold detector selects one or more threshold rules based upon the features or feature values in the vector. Where the feature vector includes a threshold for a feature value, the threshold detector tests the feature values against the threshold. The threshold detector may access prior event records in order to apply one or more threshold rules.",

    "abstract": "A virtual assistant ecosystem is presented. One can instantiate or construct a customized virtual assistant when needed by capturing a digital representation of one or more objects. A virtual assistant engine analyzes the digital representation to determine the nature or type of the objects present. The engine further obtains attributes for a desirable assistant based on the type of objects. Once the attributes are compiled the engine can then create the specific type of assistant required by the circumstances.",

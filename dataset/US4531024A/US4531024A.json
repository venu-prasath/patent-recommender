    "title": "Multilocation video conference terminal including video switching contention control",
    "abstract": "In a multilocation video conference system, contention for the video to be transmitted to the locations is resolved by employing so-called talker and graphics contention resolution processes. Both the talker and graphics contention processes may be overridden by manual selection of the video to be viewed at each location. In the talker contention process, the video to be transmitted is not switched until one and only one talker location is detected during a predetermined talker timing interval. In the graphics contention process, all requests for graphics transmission are rejected until one and only one graphics transmission request is detected during a predetermined graphics request timing interval. Once transmission of graphics has been assigned to a location, all other locations in the conference are transmitted the graphics video information until the location displaying graphics releases from the graphics transmission mode or there is a manual override. The location transmitting graphics information is transmitted the video from the last of the other locations selected for talker video transmission.",

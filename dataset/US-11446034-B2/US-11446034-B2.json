    "abstract": "A surgical stapling assembly comprising an end effector, a shaft assembly extending proximally from the end effector, a housing, a rotary motion actuator supported by the housing, a first actuation system configured to cause the end effector to perform a first function, a second actuation system configured to cause the end effector to perform a second function different from the first function, and a selector arrangement transitionable between a first orientation and a second orientation is disclosed. The end effector comprises a staple cartridge and staples deployable from the staple cartridge into tissue. The rotary motion actuator is configured to operably interface with the first actuation system in the first orientation to cause the end effector to perform the first function. The rotary motion actuator is configured to operably interface with the second actuation system to cause the end effector to perform the second function.",

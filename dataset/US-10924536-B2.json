    "abstract": "A method for locating an optimum storage node for serving a data file request received via a communications network, includes: receiving a file request from a user device coupled to the communications network; determining a geocode value based on a communications network address associated with the user device, wherein the geocode value is indicative of a geographic location of the user device; selecting a storage node from a plurality of storage nodes coupled to the communications network to serve the file request, wherein the storage node is selected based at least in part on the geocode value; and redirecting the file request to the selected storage node for handling.",
    "claims": "\n1. One or more non-transitory machine-readable media storing instructions which, when executed by one or more processors cause performance of operations comprising:\nreceiving, from a requesting device, an initial request to access a file;\nresponsive to the initial request to access the file:\nselecting a first node, from among a plurality of nodes, to provide access to the file, wherein the first node is selected from a subset of the plurality of nodes that store the requested file;\ncausing transmission of the file from the first node to the requesting device;\ndetermining that the first node is not an appropriate node to provide the file to the requesting device;\nresponsive to the determining operation, selecting a second node, from among the plurality of nodes, to provide access to the file for subsequent requests to access the file received after the initial request is received; and\ncausing the second node to retrieve a copy of the file in preparation for causing transmission of the file to the requesting device for the subsequent requests.\n2. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise:\nreceiving a subsequent second request to access the file; and\ncausing transmission of the file from the second node in response to the subsequent second request.\n3. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein the initial request comprises a device identifier associated with the requesting device, and wherein determining that the first node is not an appropriate node comprises determining that the device identifier is not present on a serve list associated with the first node.\n4. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein determining that the first node is not an appropriate node comprises:\ndetermining a geocode associated with the requesting device; and\ndetermining that the first node is an appropriate node based on a comparison of the determined geocode with a geocode associated with the first node.\n5. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein the second node is selected from a subset of nodes that are appropriate to provide the file to the requesting device.\n6. The one or more media of claim 5, wherein the subset of nodes that are appropriate to provide the file to the requesting device is determined based on respective geographical distances between each of the plurality of nodes and the requesting device being below a distance threshold.\n7. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein the second node is selected based on at least a number of pending requests at the second node.\n8. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein the second node is selected based on a transmission rate between the second node and the requesting device.\n9. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein determining that the first node is not an appropriate node to provide the file to the requesting device comprises:\nthe first node making a determination that the first node is not an appropriate node to service the initial request; and\nthe first node transmitting an indication that the first node is inappropriate to a centralized server.\n10. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein the operations causing transmission of the file from the first node to the requesting device and determining that the first node is not an appropriate node to provide the file are performed concurrently.\n11. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein the second node is selected after causing the first node to transmit the file.\n12. A method comprising:\nreceiving, from a requesting device, an initial request to access a file;\nresponsive to the initial request to access the file:\nselecting a first node, from among a plurality of nodes, to provide access to the file, wherein the first node is selected from a subset of the plurality of nodes that store the requested file;\ncausing transmission of the file from the first node to the requesting device;\ndetermining that the first node is not an appropriate node to provide the file to the requesting device;\nresponsive to the determining operation, selecting a second node, from among the plurality of nodes, to provide access to the file for subsequent requests to access the file received after the initial request is received; and\ncausing the second node to retrieve a copy of the file in preparation for causing transmission of the file to the requesting device for the subsequent requests;\nwherein the method is performed by at least one device including a hardware processor.\n13. The method of claim 12, wherein the operations further comprise:\nreceiving a second subsequent request to access the file; and\ncausing transmission of the file from the second node in response to the second subsequent request.\n14. The method of claim 12, wherein the initial request comprises a device identifier associated with the requesting device, and wherein determining that the first node is not an appropriate node comprises determining that the device identifier is not present on a serve list associated with the first node.\n15. The method of claim 12, wherein determining that the first node is not an appropriate node comprises:\ndetermining a geocode associated with the requesting device; and\ndetermining that the first node is an appropriate node based on a comparison of the determined geocode with a geocode associated with the first node.\n16. The method of claim 15, wherein the second node is selected from a subset of nodes that are appropriate to provide the file to the requesting device.\n17. The method of claim 12, wherein the subset of nodes that are appropriate to provide the file to the requesting device is determined based on respective geographical distances between each of the plurality of nodes and the requesting device being below a distance threshold.\n18. The method of claim 12, wherein the second node is selected based on at least a number of pending requests at the second node.\n19. The method of claim 12, wherein the second node is selected based on a transmission rate between the second node and the requesting device.\n20. The method of claim 12, wherein the operations causing transmission of the file from the first node to the requesting device and determining that the first node is not an appropriate node to provide the file are performed concurrently.\n21. The method of claim 12, wherein the second node is selected after causing the first node to transmit the file.\n22. A system comprising:\nat least one device including a hardware processor;\nthe system being configured to perform operations comprising:\nreceiving, from a requesting device, an initial request to access a file;\nresponsive to the initial request to access the file:\nselecting a first node, from among a plurality of nodes, to provide access to the file, wherein the first node is selected from a subset of the plurality of nodes that store the requested file;\ncausing transmission of the file from the first node to the requesting device;\ndetermining that the first node is not an appropriate node to provide the file to the requesting device;\nresponsive to the determining operation, selecting a second node, from among the plurality of nodes, to provide access to the file for subsequent requests to access the file received after the initial request is received; and\ncausing the second node to retrieve a copy of the file in preparation for causing transmission of the file to the requesting device for the subsequent requests.\n23. The system of claim 22, wherein the operations further comprise:\nreceiving a subsequent second request to access the file; and\ncausing transmission of the file from the second node in response to the subsequent second request.\n24.

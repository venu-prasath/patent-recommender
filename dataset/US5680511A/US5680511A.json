    "title": "Systems and methods for word recognition",
    "abstract": "In one aspect, the invention provides word recognition systems that operate to recognize an unrecognized or ambiguous word that occurs within a passage of words. The system can offer several words as choice words for inserting into the passage to replace the unrecognized word. The system can select the best choice word by using the choice word to extract from a reference source, sample passages of text that relate to the choice word. For example, the system can select the dictionary passage that defines the choice word. The system then compares the selected passage to the current passage, and generates a score that indicates the likelihood that the choice word would occur within that passage of text. The system can select the choice word with the best score to substitute into the passage. The passage of words being analyzed can be any word sequence including an utterance, a portion of handwritten text, a portion of typewritten text or other such sequence of words, numbers and characters. Alternative embodiments of the present invention are disclosed which function to retrieve documents from a library as a function of context.",

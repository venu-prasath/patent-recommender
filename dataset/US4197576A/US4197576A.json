    "title": "Adaptive-predictive control system",
    "abstract": "An adaptive-predictive control system for controlling single-input single-output, or multivariable time-variant processes with known or unknown parameters and with or without time delay, is disclosed. The adaptive-predictive control system of the present invention updates on real time the parameters of an adaptive-predictive model from which the dynamic output vector of the process being controlled is predicted and the control vector controlling the operation of this process is computed with the objective that the predicted dynamic output vector becomes equal to the desired dynamic output vector.",

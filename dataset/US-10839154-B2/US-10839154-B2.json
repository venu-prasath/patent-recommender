    "abstract": "Systems, devices, and methods of the present invention detect affective argumentation in text. In an example, an application executing on a computing device accesses text comprising fragments. The application creates a discourse tree from the text. The discourse tree includes nodes, each nonterminal node representing a rhetorical relationship between two of the fragments and each terminal node of the nodes of the discourse tree is associated with one of the fragments. The application matches each fragment that has a verb to a verb signature, thereby creating a communicative discourse tree. The application determines whether the communicative discourse tree represents text that includes affective argumentation by applying a classification model trained to detect affective argumentation to the communicative discourse tree.",

The method of claim 1, wherein the matching comprises:\naccessing a plurality of verb signatures, wherein each verb signature comprises the verb of a corresponding fragment and a sequence of thematic roles, wherein thematic role describes a respective relationship between the verb and related words;\ndetermining, for each verb signature of the plurality of verb signatures, a plurality of thematic roles of the respective verb signature, wherein each of the thematic roles matches a role of a word in a fragment;\nselecting a particular verb signature from the plurality of verb signatures based on the particular verb signature comprising a highest number of matches of roles; and\nassociating the particular verb signature with the fragment.\n3. The method of claim 2, wherein each verb signature of the plurality of verb signatures comprises one of (i) an adverb, (ii) a noun phrase, or (iii) a noun, and wherein associating the particular verb signature with the fragment further comprises:\nidentifying each of a plurality of thematic roles in the particular verb signature; and\nmatching, for each of the plurality of thematic roles in the particular verb signature, a corresponding word in the fragment to the thematic role.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein the determining further comprises:\ndetermining similarities between the communicative discourse tree and one or more communicative discourse trees from a training set of communicative discourse trees;\nselecting an additional communicative discourse tree from the one or more communicative discourse trees, the selection based on the additional communicative discourse tree having a highest number of similarities with the communicative discourse tree;\nidentifying whether the additional communicative discourse tree is from a positive set or a negative training set, wherein the positive set is associated with text containing argumentation and the negative set is associated with text containing no argumentation; and\ndetermining, based on the identifying, whether the text contains an argumentation or no argumentation.\n5. The method of claim 4, wherein the similarities are based on common rhetoric relations or common communicative action labels between the communicative discourse tree and the additional communicative discourse tree.\n6. The method of claim 4, wherein the similarities are based on common structures of nonterminal nodes and terminal nodes between the communicative discourse tree and the additional communicative discourses tree.\n7. The method of claim 1, wherein the classification model is a support vector machine with tree kernel learning.\n8. The method of claim 1, wherein the classification model uses nearest neighbor learning of maximal common sub-trees of communicative discourse trees or sub-trees of parse thickets.\n9. The method of claim 1, wherein affective argumentation relates to moods, feelings, or attitudes.\n10. A method for determining argumentation in text, the method comprising:\naccessing a set of training data for text in a first domain, wherein the set of training data comprises (i) a first set of communicative discourse trees each comprising an expected classification of a presence of affective argumentation and (ii) a second set of communicative discourse trees each comprising an expected classification of an absence of affective argumentation, wherein each communicative discourse tree comprises a discourse tree with a plurality of nodes, each nonterminal node representing a rhetorical relationship between at least two fragments of text, each terminal node of the nodes of the discourse tree associated with one of the fragments, and wherein each fragment that has a verb is matched to a verb signature;\ntraining a classification model to identify affective argumentation by iteratively:\nproviding a communicative discourse tree of either the first set of communicative discourse trees or the second set of communicative discourse trees to the classification model;\nreceiving, from the classification model, a determined classification;\ncalculating a loss function by calculating a difference between the determined classification and the expected classification; and\nadjusting internal parameters of the classification model to minimize the loss function;\ncreating a second communicative discourse tree for a second body of text in a second domain;\nobtaining a second classification for the second body of text by applying the trained classification model to the second communicative discourse tree; and\nresponsive to determining that the second body of text comprises affective argumentation, accessing a response that corresponds to the second body of text and outputting the response.\n11. The method of claim 10, further comprising:\nresponsive to determining that the second classification is a presence of affective argumentation, (i) sending an alert or (ii) adjusting a predetermined message.\n12. The method of claim 10, further comprising either (i) responsive to determining that the second classification is a presence of affective argumentation, identifying the second body of text as truthful or (ii) responsive to determining that the second classification is an absence of affective argumentation, identifying the second body of text as untruthful.\n13. The method of claim 10, wherein the classification model is a support vector machine with tree kernel learning.\n14. The method of claim 10, wherein the classification model uses nearest neighbor learning of maximal common sub-trees of communicative discourse trees or sub-trees of parse thickets.\n15. The method of claim 10, wherein affective argumentation relates to moods, feelings, or attitudes.\n16. The method of claim 10, wherein matching each fragment that has a verb to a verb signature comprises:\naccessing a plurality of verb signatures, wherein each verb signature comprises the verb of a fragment and a sequence of thematic roles, wherein each thematic role describes a respective relationship between the verb and related words;\ndetermining, for each verb signature of the plurality of verb signatures, a plurality of thematic roles of the respective verb signature, wherein each of the thematic roles matches a role of a word in the fragment;\nselecting a particular verb signature from the plurality of verb signatures based on the particular verb signature comprising a highest number of matches of roles; and\nassociating the particular verb signature with the fragment.\n17. A method of building a dataset of argumentation features with identified classes, the method comprising:\naccessing text from a first domain, the text comprising fragments;\ncreating a communicative discourse tree from the text by:\ncreating a discourse tree comprises a plurality of nodes, each nonterminal node representing a rhetorical relationship between two of the fragments and each terminal node of the nodes of the discourse tree is associated with one of the fragments; and\nmatching each fragment that has a verb to a verb signature, thereby creating a communicative discourse tree;\naccessing a positive communicative discourse tree from a positive training data set and a negative training data communicative discourse tree from a negative training data set, wherein the positive training data set comprises communicative discourse trees representing text containing affective argumentation, and the negative training data set comprises communicative discourse trees representing text without affective argumentation and wherein the communication discourse trees for the positive training data set and negative training data set are each based on text from a second domain;\nidentifying whether the communicative discourse tree is from the positive training data set or the negative training data set by applying a classification model to the communicative discourse tree;\nadding the communicative discourse tree to either the positive training data set or the negative training data set based on the identified class;\ntraining a classification model, with the positive training data set and the negative training data set;\napplying the trained classification model to additional text; and\noutputting a classification received from the trained classification model.\n18.

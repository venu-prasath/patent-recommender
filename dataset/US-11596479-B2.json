    "abstract": "A computer-implemented method for creating an activity-optimized cutting guides for surgical procedures includes receiving one or more pre-operative images depicting one or more anatomical joints of a patient, and creating a three-dimensional anatomical model of the one or more anatomical joints based on the one or more pre-operative images. One or more patient-specific anatomical measurements are determined based on the three-dimensional anatomical model. A statistical model of joint performance is applied to the patient-specific anatomical measurements to identify one or more cut angles for performing a surgical procedure. A patient-specific cutting guide is created that comprises one or more apertures positioned based on the one or more cut angles.",

    "title": "Method, system, and computer program product for visualizing a data structure",
    "abstract": "A data structure visualization tool visualizes a data structure such as a decision table classifier. A data file based on a data set of relational data is stored as a relational table, where each row represents an aggregate of all the records for each combination of values of the attributes used. Once loaded into memory, an inducer is used to construct a hierarchy of levels, called a decision table classifier, where each successive level in the hierarchy has two fewer attributes. Besides a column for each attribute, there is a column for the record count (or more generally, sum of record weights), and a column containing a vector of probabilities (each probability gives the proportion of records in each class). Finally, at the top-most level, a single row represents all the data. The decision table classifier is then passed to the visualization tool for display and the decision table classifier is visualized. By building a representative scene graph adaptively, the visualization application never loads the whole data set into memory. Interactive techniques, such as drill-down and drill-through are used view further levels of detail or to retrieve some subset of the original data. The decision table visualizer helps a user understand the importance of specific attribute values for classification.",

    "claims": "\n1. A computer-implemented method of visualizing a multi-dimensional data set, wherein a data file is generated from the data set, wherein the data file includes a plurality of records, each record having at least one value associated with at least one attribute, the data file arranged in a tabular form having a plurality of rows and columns, wherein each of the rows represents an aggregate of all of the records for each combination of the values of the attributes, and wherein a label corresponds to one of the attributes of the data file, wherein the label has one or more associated label values called classes, comprising the steps of:\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein the data structure is a decision table classifier, wherein step (a) comprises:\n3. The method of claim 2, wherein step (b) comprises:\n4. The method of claim 3, wherein said step (a) is performed on a computer system that has implemented on it an inducer to autorratically select attributes to put at each level of said decision table classifier.\n5. The method of claim 3, wherein step (b) further comprises:\n6. The method of claim 5, further comprising:\n7. The method of claim 6, wherein said visualization includes one or more graphical representations corresponding to at least one of said levels of said decision table classifier, said graphical representation corresponding to two of the attributes of said decision table, wherein each of said graphical representations are referred to as a cake chart.\n8. The method of claim 7, wherein said decision table pane view includes a matrix of one or more of said cake charts, each of said cake charts representing a probability distribution of each of the attribute values at a respective level of said decision table.\n9. The method of claim 7, wherein each of said cake charts represents a normalized conditional probability of each of the attribute values at a respective level of said decision table.\n10. The method of claim 7, wherein said constructing step comprises:\n11. The method of claim 10, wherein a viewer desires to observe more detail in said visualization, further comprising:\n12. The method of claim 11, further comprising:\n13. The method of claim 11, further comprising:\n14. The method of claim 5, further comprising the step of:\n15. The method of claim 4, further comprising the step of:\n16. A system for visualizing a multi-dimensional data set, wherein a data file is generated from the data set, wherein a data structure is created from the data file that includes a plurality of labeled records, each record having at least one attribute value and a corresponding class label, and the data structure being capable of assigning class labels to unlabeled records based on attribute values found in the unlabeled records, wherein the data structure comprises more than one level arranged in a hierarchal manner, comprising:\n17. The system of claim 16, further comprising:\n18. The system of said 17, further comprising:\n19. A computer program product comprising a computer useable medium having computer program logic recorded thereon for enabling a processor in a computer system to visually represent the structure of a decision table classifier, the decision table classifier being generated from a training set of labeled records, each record having at least one attribute value and a corresponding class label, and the decision table classifier being capable of assigning class labels to unlabeled records based on attribute values found in the unlabeled records, wherein the decision table classifier comprises more than one level arranged in a hierarchical manner, said computer program logic comprising:\n20.

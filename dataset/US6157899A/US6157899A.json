    "title": "Prediction of responses to different powdering tests on a galvanneal-coated steel substrate or different tests on other substrates, using computer-based systems and methods",
    "abstract": "Computer-based systems and methods of determining product parameters, performing process control, and/or classifying products are provided. These computer-based systems and methods analyze previous responses to different iterations of one or more tests and, based on this analysis, predict responses to future tests. The predictions are based on a classification and regression tree analysis. Also provided are computer-based systems which are pre-programmed with the results of at least one such analysis and which perform product parameter determination, process control, and/or product classifications based upon those results. The methods and computer systems are particularly well-suited for use in the context of manufacturing galvanneal-coated steel products (e.g., strips, sheets, plates, rods, wires, and the like), though it is understood that the methods and computer systems are not limited to use on such semi-finished products or their methods of manufacture. To the contrary, these methods and computer systems can be successfully applied to processes of manufacturing any product irrespective of its form. Coated and uncoated products can be manufactured according to the subject methods and systems. The methods and systems also can be applied to the manufacturing of substrates other than steel (e.g., aluminum), regardless of whether those substrates are coated, uncoated, or semi-finished.",

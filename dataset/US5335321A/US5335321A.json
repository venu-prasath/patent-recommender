    "title": "Scalable multimedia platform architecture",
    "abstract": "The scalable platform architecture of the present video processing system invention includes a bus for transmitting data between various video processing subsystems. A graphics processing subsystem is coupled to the bus. A central processing unit is coupled to the bus and performs video processing. The graphics processing subsystem is adapted to receive a video memory and to perform video processing when the video memory is received. The bus is provided with expansion connectors for detachably coupling to a video processing subsystem and a video capture system. The addition of the video processing subsystem and/or video capture subsystem accelerates the processing of the video processing system by performing video processing that would otherwise be performed by the central processing unit.",

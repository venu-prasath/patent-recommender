    "abstract": "A system and method for assisting in the preparation of a document, and for analyzing a document, such as a patent or patent application, are described herein. The system aids a user to verify that terms in a patent application are being used consistently. The system also facilitates editing of the patent application so as to achieve terminology consistency. The system operates by allowing a user to select a document containing a patent application. The user then selects the specification portion of the patent application, and also selects the claims portion of the patent application. The system indexes the specification portion and the claims portion to thereby generate a merged index table. The system analyzes the merged index table to identify terms in the claims portion that are not present in the specification portion, and then displays these terms (called claim terms). A user can then edit the patent application so as to properly describe these terms in the specification.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for comparing text portions, comprising the steps of:\n(1) indexing a first selected non-predefined text portion to generate first index information;\n(2) indexing a second selected non-predefined text portion to generate second index information; and\n(3) comparing said first and second index information generated in steps (1) and (2).\n2. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of:\n(4) identifying differences between said first and second text portions by reference to results of said comparison performed in step (3).\n3. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of:\n(4) identifying similarities between said first and second text portions by reference to results of said comparison performed in step (3).\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein step (1) results in generating a first index table, and step (2) results in generating a second index table.\n5. The method of claim 4, further comprising the step of:\nmerging said first and second index tables to thereby generate a merged index table.\n6. The method of claim 5, wherein step (3) comprises the step of:\ndetermining by reference to said merged index table terms that are present in said second text portion, but not present in said first text portion.\n7. The method of claim 4, wherein said first text portion and said second text portion are from the same document.\n8. A system for comparing text portions, comprising:\nfirst text portion indexing means for indexing a first selected non-predefined text portion to generate first index information;\nsecond text portion indexing means for indexing a second selected non-predefined text portion to generate second index information; and\nindex comparing means for comparing said first and second index information generated by said first and second text portion indexing means.\n9. The system of claim 8, further comprising:\nmeans for identifying differences between said first and second text portions by reference to results of said comparison performed by said index comparing means.\n10. The system of claim 8, further comprising:\nmeans for identifying similarities between said first and second text portions by reference to results of said comparison performed by said index comparing means.\n11. The system of claim 8, wherein said first text portion indexing means generates a first index table, and said second text portion indexing means generates a second index table.\n12. The system of claim 11, further comprising:\nmeans for merging said first and second index tables to thereby generate a merged index table.\n13. The system of claim 12, wherein said index comparing means comprises:\nmeans for determining by reference to said merged index table terms that are present in said second text portion, but not present in said first text portion.\n14. The system of claim 8, wherein said first text portion and said second text portion are from the same document.\n15. A computer program product having control logic stored therein, said control logic, when executed, enabling a computer to compare text portions, said control logic comprising:\nfirst text portion indexing means for enabling the computer to index a first selected non-predefined text portion to generate first index information;\nsecond text portion indexing means for enabling the computer to index a second selected non-predefined text portion to generate second index information; and\nindex comparing means for enabling the computer to compare said first and second index information generated by said first and second text portion indexing means.\n16. The computer program product of claim 15, said control logic further comprising:\nmeans for enabling the computer to identify differences between said first and second text portions by reference to results of said comparison performed by said index comparing means.\n17. The computer program product of claim 15, said control logic further comprising:\nmeans for enabling the computer to identify similarities between said first and second text portions by reference to results of said comparison performed by said index comparing means.\n18. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein said first text portion indexing means enables the computer to generate a first index table, and said second text portion indexing means enables the computer to generate a second index table.\n19. The computer program product of claim 18, said control logic further comprising:\nmeans for enabling the computer to merge said first and second index tables to thereby generate a merged index table.\n20. The computer program product of claim 19, wherein said index comparing means comprises:\nmeans for enabling the computer to determine by reference to said merged index table terms that are present in said second text portion, but not present in said first text portion.\n21. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein said first text portion and said second text portion are from the same document.",

    "abstract": "A method of organizing information in which the search activity of a user is monitored and such activity is used to organize articles in a subsequent search. The invention operates by assigning scores to articles under key term components in an index. As users enter search queries and select articles, the scores are altered according to, among other things, the amount of time spent inspecting an article, whether the article is the last one inspected, how many articles are ranked higher than the article, how many articles have been previously inspected by the user, and whether an advertising banner was selected by the user.",

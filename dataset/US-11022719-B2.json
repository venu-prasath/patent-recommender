    "abstract": "In an approach, a method for fusing point data with areal averages is performed by a computing system. The fusion procedure is coherent, in the sense that the computing system takes into account what the areal averages represent with respect to the point data. The overarching goal is to fit a model that takes into account the information derived from both data sets. The areal averages provide an estimate for what the integral of a model representing the behavior of the environmental variable should be over a particular district and the point values indicate the estimated value at particular locations. Thus, the integral of the fitted model over a district of the grid should approximate the value provided by the areal averages while also approximating the value provided by the point data for locations which are provided by the point data.",

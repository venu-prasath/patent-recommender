The system of claim 1, wherein the partition manager receives resource partition state information and provides resource adjustment information to the resource broker, and wherein the resource broker provides resource costs to the partition manager and commands for resource adjustments to the resource controller.\n3. The system of claim 1, wherein the resources are a combination of compute, storage, wired connectivity resources and wireless connectivity resources.\n4. The system of claim 1, wherein the virtual resources include dynamic compositions of chained Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), and wherein the physical resources include any of hard slices and soft slices of the network.\n5. The system of claim 1, wherein the resource broker utilizes pricing on resource usage to ensure the partition manager gives up corresponding resources when they are not needed in a partition managed by the partition manager.\n6. The system of claim 1, wherein the partition manager is configured to\nmonitor Quality of Service (QoS) in the network,\ndetermine required resources in the network to meet Service Layer Agreements (SLAs) and to maximize long-term rewards,\none or more of request and release corresponding resources in the network to maximize the long-term rewards, and\ndetermine costs of the resources and correlate the costs to the long-term rewards.\n7. The system of claim 6, wherein the long-term rewards are determined by calculating long-term network cost which includes a cost of resources plus a cost of not meeting Service Layer Agreements (SLAs).\n8. The system of claim 1, wherein the resource broker is configured to monitor resource usage in the network,\ndetermine prices of resources in the network based on the resource usage and to maximize long-term rewards,\nreceive a request for associated resources and grant the request if the resources are available and block the resources if unavailable, and\ndetermine costs of the resources and correlate the costs to the long-term rewards.\n9.

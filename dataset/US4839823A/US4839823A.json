    "title": "Automatic trouble analysis apparatus and method thereof",
    "abstract": "In a trouble analysis apparatus, a cause of an accident which is empirically and statistically obtained, and a plurality of effects corresponding to the cause are entered in advance at a keyboard and stored as a data base in a magnetic disk unit. In this case, a sum of basic probabilities of the plurality of effects for the cause is set to be 1. A pre-processor calculates as upper (or lower) probability of a subset of the result by using the Dempster & Shafer probability theory. The pre-processor uses the upper or lower probability to create Fuzzy membership functions, and also creates a hypothetical proposition for corresponding the Fuzzy membership function and the cause. An inference engine matches accident phenomena with the effects when an accident occurs and infers the cause by a modified Fuzzy inference method using the hypothetical proposition.",

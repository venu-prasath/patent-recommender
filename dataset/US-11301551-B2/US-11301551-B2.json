    "abstract": "Access to computing assets is controlled by dynamically selecting an authentication process for an access attempt to a computing asset. In an example embodiment, when an indication of an access attempt for a computing asset is received, a security level associated with the computing asset is determined. Based on the security level associated with the computing asset, an authentication process is selected from a plurality of authentication processes, and the selected authentication process is executed in relation to the access attempt for the computing asset. In further embodiments, the authentication process is further selected based on a comparison of an access characteristic associated with the access attempt for the computing asset and an access characteristic for a user associated with the access attempt.",
    "claims": "\n1. A computer-implement method comprising:\nreceiving an indication of an access attempt for a first computing asset using an identity of a first user of a plurality of users;\ndetermining a security level associated with the first computing asset, the security level being determined based on at least one access characteristic associated with the first user, wherein the at least one access characteristic is generated by a machine learning algorithm;\nselecting, based on the security level associated with the first computing asset, a first authentication process from a plurality of authentication processes; and\nexecuting the first authentication process in relation to the access attempt for the first computing asset.\n2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising:\nreceiving an indication of an access attempt for a second computing asset using the identity of the first user;\ndetermining a security level associated with the second computing asset, the security level associated with the second computing asset being higher than the security level associated with the first computing asset;\nselecting, based on the security level associated with the second computing asset, a second authentication process from the plurality of authentication processes; and\nexecuting the second authentication process in relation to the access attempt for the second computing asset.\n3. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, wherein the second authentication process requires additional information not required in the first authentication process.\n4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the first authentication process is further selected based on a comparison of at least one access characteristic associated with the access attempt for the first computing asset and the at least one access characteristic for the first user.\n5. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, wherein the at least one access characteristic for the first user is determined from access data indicating an access history of the first user to one or more computing assets.\n6. The computer-implemented method of claim 5, wherein the at least one access characteristic for the first user is determined by:\nanalyzing, by the machine learning algorithm, the access data to generate a set of access characteristics for the first user that includes the at least one access characteristic for the first user.\n7.

The one or more computer-readable media of claim of claim 9, wherein the first authentication process is further selected based on a requested privilege level associated with the access attempt for the first computing asset.\n17. A system comprising:\none or more processors; and\none or more computer-readable media storing computer-useable instructions that, when used by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform operations comprising:\nreceiving an indication of an access attempt for a first computing asset using an identity of a first user of a plurality of users;\ndetermining a security level associated with the first computing asset, the security level being determined based on at least one access characteristic associated with the first user, wherein the at least one access characteristic is generated by a machine learning algorithm;\nselecting, based on the security level associated with the first computing asset, a first authentication process from a plurality of authentication processes; and\nexecuting the first authentication process in relation to the access attempt for the first computing asset.\n18. The system of claim 17, further comprising:\nreceiving an indication of an access attempt for a second computing asset using the identity of the first user;\ndetermining a security level associated with the second computing asset, the security level associated with the second computing asset being higher than the security level associated with the first computing asset;\nselecting, based on the security level associated with the second computing asset, a second authentication process from the plurality of authentication processes; and\nexecuting the second authentication process in relation to the access attempt for the second computing asset.\n19. The system of claim 17, wherein the first authentication process is further selected based on a comparison of at least one access characteristic associated with the access attempt for the first computing asset and the at least one access characteristic for the first user, and wherein the at least one access characteristic for the first user is determined from access data indicating an access history of the first user to one or more computing assets.\n20.

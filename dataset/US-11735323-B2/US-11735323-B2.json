    "abstract": "A method, software, database and system for attribute partner identification and social network based attribute analysis are presented in which attribute profiles associated with individuals can be compared and potential partners identified. Connections can be formed within social networks based on analysis of genetic and non-genetic data. Degrees of attribute separation (genetic and non-genetic) can be utilized to analyze relationships and to identify individuals who might benefit from being connected.",
    "claims": "\n1. A computer-implemented method comprising:\ncomparing genomic nucleotide sequences within genetic information of an individual with genomic nucleotide sequences within genetic information of a population of individuals, wherein the comparing determines respective degrees of overlap between the genomic nucleotide sequences of the individual and the genomic nucleotide sequences of the population of individuals;\ncalculating, based on the degrees of overlap, a subset of individuals from the population of individuals with degrees of overlap that are greater than a threshold value;\ntransmitting, to a client device, a representation of a graphical user interface that identifies the subset of individuals as genetic relatives; and\nbased on input from the client device, establishing a network between the individual and one or more members of the subset of individuals identified as genetic relatives.\n2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising:\nranking the subset of individuals identified as genetic relatives according to their degrees of overlap, wherein the graphical user interface displays the rankings.\n3.

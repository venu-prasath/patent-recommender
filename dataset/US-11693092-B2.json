    "abstract": "Various embodiments wirelessly detect micro gestures using multiple antenna of a gesture sensor device. At times, the gesture sensor device transmits multiple outgoing radio frequency (RF) signals, each outgoing RF signal transmitted via a respective antenna of the gesture sensor device. The outgoing RF signals are configured to help capture information that can be used to identify micro-gestures performed by a hand. The gesture sensor device captures incoming RF signals generated by the outgoing RF signals reflecting off of the hand, and then analyzes the incoming RF signals to identify the micro-gesture.",

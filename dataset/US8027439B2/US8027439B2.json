    "abstract": "A method for dynamically updating a model is described. The method includes accessing a model that specifies expected characteristics for a transaction. The model includes variables associated with fraud. The method also includes receiving at least one value for each of the variables while monitoring transactions, and updating a distribution of values for each variable based on the received value. The received value is compared with the updated distribution to determine a deviation from a threshold value associated with a percentile of the updated distribution that is indicative of fraud.",

    "claims": "\n1. A method for dynamically updating a model comprising:\naccessing a model that specifies expected characteristics for a transaction, wherein the model comprises variables associated with fraud;\nreceiving at least one value for each of the variables while monitoring transactions;\nupdating a distribution of values for each variable based on the received value, wherein the received value is compared with the updated distribution to determine a deviation from a threshold value associated with a percentile of the updated distribution that is indicative of fraud; and\nscaling the determined deviation based on a variance range between the threshold value and a maximum expected value of the updated distribution.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein the scaled determined deviation is calculated based on an equation comprising:\n3. The method of claim 2, further comprising determining a score indicative of a probability of fraud for the transaction based on the scaled determined deviation.\n4. The method of claim 3, wherein the score is calculated based on an equation comprising:\n\n\u03b7=\u03a3q(x i|\u03b8)\nwhere \u03b7 is the score.\n5. The method of claim 4, further comprising weighting each scaled determined deviation with a coefficient correlated to an assigned importance of each variable within the model.\n6. The method of claim 4, further comprising applying an adaptive score calibration to the score so that scores between model segments are normalized.\n7. The method of claim 1, further comprising scaling the determined deviation based on a variance range assigned or selected by a user.\n8. The method of claim 1, further comprising scaling the determined deviation based on a variance range between the percentile of the updated distribution that is indicative for fraud and a percentile of the updated distribution that is indicative of a maximum significant value.\n9. The method of claim 1, further comprising generating a preliminary distribution of values for each variable based on an aggregation of historical transactions, wherein generating the distribution of values occurs before updating the distribution of values.\n10. The method of claim 1, wherein the model includes a global model that specifies expected characteristics for the transaction based on substantially all of the monitored transactions.\n11. The method of claim 1, wherein the model comprises segments.\n12. The method of claim 11, wherein at least one of the segments is generated based on user input.\n13. The method of claim 11, wherein the at least one segment's expected characteristics for the transaction differ from expected characteristics of other segments of the global model.\n14. The method of claim 13, further comprising identifying the received value as associated with the at least one segment and exclusively updating, relative to the other segments, the distribution of values for each variable of the at least one segment based on the received value.\n15. The method of claim 14, further comprising updating the distribution of values for each variable of the global model based on the received value.\n16. The method of claim 14, further comprising determining a score indicative of a probability of fraud for the transaction based on the updated at least one segment.\n17. The method of claim 15, further comprising determining a score indicative of a probability of fraud for the transaction based on the updated global model if substantially insufficient statistics have been gathered for the at least one segment.\n18. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining a score indicative of a probability of fraud for the transaction based on the deviation of the received value from the threshold.\n19. The method of claim 1, wherein the percentile of the updated distribution that is indicative of fraud is different from percentiles of the updated distribution for other variables in the model.\n20. The method of claim 1, wherein the variables are included in a service profile of the model, the service profile being associated with a party related to the transaction.\n21. The method of claim 20, further comprising extracting a profile identifier from the transaction and identifying the service profile based on the profile identifier.\n22. The method of claim 1, wherein the distribution of values for each variable are included in a model profile of the model, the model profile specifying the expected characteristics for the transaction.\n23. A method for processing a transaction comprising:\nreceiving, at a second computing device and from a first computing device that initiates an electronic transaction, a value for a variable associated with the transaction, wherein the variable is indicative of fraud;\nupdating, by the second computing device, a distribution of values for the variable based on the received value, wherein the updated distribution of values is used to determine a deviation of the received value from a selected value in the updated distribution;\nscaling the determined deviation based on a variance range between the selected value and a maximum expected value of the updated distribution; and\ndetermining a score indicative of a probability of fraud for the transaction, wherein the score is based on the deviation of the received value from the selected value and is proportionate to an existence of fraud in the electronic transaction.\n24. The method of claim 23, wherein the selected value is based on a fixed percentage of the distribution values, and wherein the fixed percentage defines a threshold above which values are determined to be substantially atypical for the variable.\n25. A system for determining fraud comprising:\nan interface to receive values associated with a transaction, each value corresponding to a property correlated to fraudulent transactions;\na profile updater to modify a distribution of values for each property based on the corresponding received value; and\na score calculator to generate a fraud score for the transaction, wherein generating the fraud score comprises:\ncomparing the received value with the modified distribution of values to determine a deviation of the received value from a threshold value of the modified distribution of values, wherein the threshold value corresponds to a threshold percentile of the modified distribution of values at which received values begin to be identified as indicative of fraud, and\nscaling the determined deviation to the difference between the threshold value and a maximum expected value for the modified distribution of values.\n26. A method for generating a fraud indicator comprising:\ngenerating a score indicative of a probability of fraud for a transaction, the generating comprising aggregating self-scaling variables, wherein the self-scaling variables are determined by:\nreceiving for each self-scaling variable a received value;\nupdating a distribution of values for each self-scaling variable with the value received for the self-scaling variable;\ndetermining for each self-scaling variable an updated threshold value that is based on the updated distribution of values, wherein the updated threshold value indicates a beginning of a range of values that are unusual relative to the updated distribution, wherein the updated threshold value replaces a previous threshold value that was for the self-scaling variable before the value for the self-scaling variable was received; and\nscaling the received value based on the updated threshold value.\n27. The method of claim 26, further comprising receiving values for the self-scaling variables associated with transactions during a monitoring of the transactions, wherein each self-scaling variable is an indicator of a probability of fraud.\n28.

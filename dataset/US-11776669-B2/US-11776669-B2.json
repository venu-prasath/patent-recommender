    "abstract": "Systems and methods for conducting automated synthetic interactions with a user, such as a patient at home following a medical procedure. A digital coach having a processor and memory initiates a session with a user's interactive device, and presents pre-recorded scripts as video and/or audio through the interactive device. The user's responses are received by the digital coach through the interactive device. Peripheral devices, such as medical devices, may be used by the user or controlled by the digital coach to obtain data measurements regarding the physiological condition of the user. The processor of the digital coach analyzes the data from the user responses and devices, and semantically interprets the responses and data to determine the next action and script to present the user in the session. The digital coach provides a conversational, dynamic, adaptive session with a user based on semantically expanded interpretations of data by the processor.",

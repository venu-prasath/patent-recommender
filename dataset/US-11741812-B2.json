    "abstract": "A building management system includes one or more computer-readable storage media having a data structure, wherein the data structure comprises a plurality of vulnerabilities and a plurality of pairs, each of the plurality of pairs comprising one of a plurality of assets and one of the plurality of threat types, wherein each of the plurality of pairs is associated with one of the plurality of vulnerabilities and instructions. The instructions cause one or more processors to receive a threat, the threat comprising a particular threat type of the plurality of threat types, the threat indicating an incident affecting a risk value associated with a particular asset of the plurality of assets, identify a particular vulnerability of the data structure based on the particular threat type and the particular asset, and determine, based on the particular vulnerability and the threat, the risk value associated with the particular asset.",

The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the risk card comprises an indication of the asset and the risk value associated with the asset.\n3. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the risk card comprises an indication of the asset and the risk value associated with the asset.\n4. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the risk card is based on the risk value associated with the asset and the vulnerability levels of the asset.\n5. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the risk card is based on the risk value associated with the asset and the vulnerability levels for the asset, the risk card further comprises:\nan indication of the asset;\nthe risk value associated with the asset; and\nthe vulnerability levels associated with each of the plurality of threat types for the asset.\n6. The risk management system of claim 1, further comprising a user interface to display the risk card.\n7. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the asset is at least one of a user, a space, a building, or a device.\n8. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of vulnerability values is a numeric value indicating an amount that the asset is affected by each of the plurality of threat types, wherein the numeric value is between zero and one.\n9. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the data structure is a matrix comprising a first dimension, wherein a plurality of assets including the asset are associated with the first dimension.\n10. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the data structure is a matrix comprising a first dimension and a second dimension, wherein a plurality of assets including the asset are associated with the first dimension and the plurality of threat types are associated with the second dimension.\n11. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the instructions cause the one or more processors to:\nprovide a data structure retrieve endpoint, wherein the data structure retrieve endpoint is configured to provide the data structure to a requesting device; and\nprovide a data structure update endpoint, wherein the data structure update endpoint is configured to update vulnerabilities of the data structure based on updates received from the requesting device.\n12. The risk management system of claim 1, wherein the instructions cause the one or more processors to:\nreceive, via a user interface, a first update to a vulnerability associated with the asset and the particular threat type; and\nupdate the data structure with the first update to the vulnerability; generate, for the asset, a set of threat types that the asset is vulnerable to based on the data structure, wherein the set of threat types are threat types that affect the risk value of the asset;\ncause the user interface to display the set of threat types;\nreceive, via the user interface, a second update to the set of threat types, the second update comprising an indication to add one or more new threat types, wherein the data structure does not indicate that the risk value of the asset is affected by the one or more new threat types; and\nupdate the plurality of vulnerability values of the data structure based on the second update by adding vulnerabilities based on the indication to add the one or more new threat types of the set of threat types.\n13. A method for risk analysis, the method comprising:\nreceiving, by one or more processing circuits, a threat, the threat comprising a particular threat type of a plurality of threat types, the threat indicating an incident affecting a risk value associated with a particular asset of a plurality of assets;\nretrieving, by the one or more processing circuits, a particular vulnerability of a data structure based on the particular threat type and the particular asset, wherein the data structure comprises a plurality of vulnerabilities and a plurality of pairs, each of the plurality of pairs comprising one of the plurality of assets and one of the plurality of threat types, wherein each of the plurality of pairs is associated with one of the plurality of vulnerabilities;\ndetermining, by the one or more processing circuits, based on the particular vulnerability and the threat, the risk value associated with the particular asset; and\ngenerating, by the one or more processing circuits, based on the risk value associated with the particular asset, a risk card.\n14.

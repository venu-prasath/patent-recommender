    "title": "Method and apparatus for controlling thrust in a gas turbine engine",
    "abstract": "Gas turbine engine thrust is controlled by automatically adjusting compressor rotational speed with novel functions of engine inlet temperature to hold thrust to rated values for varying engine inlet temperature conditions. Furthermore, compressor rotational speed is automatically adjusted as a function of inlet pressure to provide a thrust rating schedule which varies with altitude. Compressor corrected rotational speed is limited through a novel function of engine inlet temerature to protect against turbine overtemperature when the engine inlet temperature exceeds the flat thrust rating point.",

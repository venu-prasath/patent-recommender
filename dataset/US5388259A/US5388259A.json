    "title": "System for accessing a database with an iterated fuzzy query notified by retrieval response",
    "abstract": "A method and system are disclosed for evaluating imprecise database queries. At the time the imprecise query is executed, a membership function, representing the imprecise criteria of the query, is applied to entries of the databases. Data items are then accordingly identified depending on the results obtained from applying the membership function to entries of the database.",

    "claims": "\n1. In an electronic data processing system comprising a data processor and a memory, a method for executing an imprecise query to identify particular records from a database stored in memory comprising the steps of\nusing said processor, electronically retrieving at least some of the records of said database from said memory,\nusing said processor, electronically determining for each record retrieved from said memory a possibility value in the range between zero and one representing the possibility of the record being in the answer set of the imprecise query by evaluating a statistical membership function to values of at least one particular attribute of each record retrieved from said memory,\nusing said processor, electronically identifying selected ones of said records retrieved from said database which have non-zero possibility values and satisfy said imprecise query,\nmodifying said membership function in response to the execution of said query, and\nre-executing said query in said electronic data processing system by applying said modified membership function to at least some of the records of said database.\n2. In an electronic data processing system comprising a data processor and a memory, a method for executing an imprecise query to identify particular records from a database stored in memory comprising the steps of\nusing said processor, electronically retrieving at least some of the records of said database from said memory by repetitively broadcasting a sequence of records from the database over a broadcast channel,\nusing said processor, electronically determining for each record retrieved from said memory a possibility value in the range between zero and one representing the possibility of the record being in the answer set of the imprecise query by evaluating a membership function defined at the time the query is executed to values of at least one particular attribute of each record retrieved from said memory during execution when each record is retrieved from said memory, said determining step comprising using at least one filter comprised in said processor for electronically applying said membership function to said attribute values of said records retrieved from said memory as said database is broadcast over said channel,\nusing said processor, electronically identifying selected ones of said records retrieved from said database stored in memory which have non-zero possibility values and satisfy said imprecise query,\nmodifying said membership function in response to the execution of said query to provide a broadened response, and\nre-executing said query in said electronic data processing system by applying said modified membership function to at least some of the records of said database.",

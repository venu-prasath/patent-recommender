    "abstract": "Systems, methods, devices, server computers, storage media, and instructions for prioritized device action triggered by device scan data are described. In one embodiment, a mobile device performs a method that involves executing a messaging application with an image capture interface and a scanning input. An associated scanning mode comprises capture of scan data from a plurality of input/output modules of the first client device, analyzes the scan data to identify one or more scan data patterns by matching at least a portion of the scan data against a set of data patterns, and selects a priority system action based on the results of the matching of the portion of the scan data against the set of data patterns. In some embodiments, the priority system action is selected based on a priority ranking for identified scan data types.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method comprising:\ncausing, by a processor, an input device to capture scan data;\nmatching the scan data with a plurality of data patterns to identify a plurality of identified data patterns of the plurality of data patterns;\nselecting a first identified data pattern of the plurality of identified data patterns based on a pattern type ranking, wherein the plurality of identified data patterns is associated with a plurality of system actions, and wherein the first identified data pattern is associated with a first system action of the plurality of system actions; and\ncausing to be displayed, by a client device, an indication of the first system action.\n2. The method of claim 1 wherein causing to be displayed further comprises:\ncausing to be displayed on a display of the client device an interface including an option to perform the first system action.\n3. The method of claim 1 wherein, the input device is a camera, the scan data comprises an image comprising a scan code, and the pattern type ranking comprises a first level ranking for a scan code pattern.\n4. The method of claim 1 wherein the plurality of data patterns comprises:\nthe scan code pattern;\nan audio signature pattern;\na logo pattern;\na register trademark pattern;\na pattern associated with a third-party registered keyword; and\na pattern associated with a system keyword.\n5. The method of claim 1 wherein the input device is one of a plurality of input devices and the capture data is one of a plurality of capture data captured by the plurality of input devices.\n6. The method of claim 5 wherein the plurality of input devices comprises two or more of the following group:\na camera device, a position sensor, a temperature sensor, a motion sensor, a microphone, and a wireless communication device.\n7.

    "abstract": "The present invention provides a system and method for building and analyzing a quantitative model from qualitative tacit knowledge. In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for creating and analyzing a model of a user's semantic knowledge. The semantic knowledge model is based on cause and effect relationships as defined by the user. In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for creating and analyzing a model of a user's episodic knowledge. The episodic knowledge model is based on the user's past experiences, including recalled stimuli and responses. The semantic and episodic models are used to describe the users internal mental model.",
    "claims": "\n1. A computerized method performed on a computer, the method comprising:\nproviding output on a screen of the computer from a cause-and-effect model, to a user, wherein the providing includes displaying output effect values;\nreceiving in the computer from the user one or more desired effect values that are different from one or more corresponding of the output effect values; and\nmodifying, in the computer, the cause-and-effect model as a function of difference between the one or more desired effect values and the one or more corresponding output effect values;\nwherein the cause-and-effect model includes a matrix of causes and effects, with numerical values each representing an influence the corresponding cause has on the corresponding effect; and\nwherein the modifying includes changing numerical influence values as a function of the difference between the one or more desired effect values and the one or more corresponding output effect values; and\nfurther comprising, prior to the providing the output, constructing the cause-and effect model, wherein the constructing includes:\nreceiving from the user the matrix of causes and effects, wherein the matrix of causes and effects is entered into the computer using a graphical user interface of the computer; and\nreceiving from the user the numerical influence values for the matrix.\n2. The method of claim 1,\nwherein the constructing also includes receiving from the user relative importance values associated with at least some of the causes; and\nwherein the modifying includes changing the influence values as a function of both the relative importance values and the difference between the one or more desired effect values and the one or more corresponding output effect values.\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein the constructing also includes receiving from the user bias values associated with at least some of the effects.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein the constructing also includes receiving from the user faith values associated with at least some cause-and-effect pairs.\n5. The method of claim 1, further comprising, after the constructing and before the providing the output, validating the model, wherein the validating includes:\nreceiving from the user cause values associated with the causes; and\ncalculating the output effect values from the causes and the influence values.\n6. A computerized method performed on a computer, the method comprising:\nproviding output on a screen of the computer from a cause-and-effect model, to a user, wherein the providing includes displaying output effect values;\nreceiving in the computer from the user one or more desired effect values that are different from one or more corresponding of the output effect values; and\nmodifying, in the computer, the cause-and-effect model as a function of difference between the one or more desired effect values and the one or more corresponding output effect values;\nwherein the receiving includes receiving input by the user manipulating the output display on the screen;\nwherein the manipulating includes the user clicking and dragging on graphical representations of the output effect values;\nwherein the providing includes providing a bar graph of output effect values as the graphical representations of the output effect values;\nwherein the cause-and-effect model includes a matrix of causes and effects, with numerical values each representing an influence the corresponding cause has on the corresponding effect; and\nwherein the modifying includes changing numerical influence values as a function of the difference between the one or more desired effect values and the one or more corresponding output effect values.\n7. The method of claim 6,\nwherein the receiving also includes receiving from the user one or more confidence levels associated with respective of the one or more desired effect values;\nwherein the modifying includes changing the influence values as a function of both the one or more confidence levels and the difference between the one or more desired effect values and the one or more corresponding output effect values.\n8. The method of claim 7,\nwherein the model also includes relative importance values associated with at least some of the causes; and\nwherein the modifying includes changing the influence values as a function of the relative importance values, the one or more confidence levels, and the difference between the one or more desired effect values and the one or more corresponding output effect values.\n9. The method of claim 8,\nfurther comprising, prior to the providing the output, constructing the cause-and effect model, wherein the constructing includes:\nreceiving from the user the matrix of causes and effects, wherein the matrix of causes and effects is entered into the computer using a graphical user interface of the computer; and\nreceiving from the user the numerical influence values for the matrix.\n10. The method of claim 9, wherein the constructing also includes receiving from the user bias values associated with at least some of the effects.\n11. The method of claim 10, wherein the constructing also includes receiving from the user faith values associated with at least some cause-and-effect pairs.\n12.

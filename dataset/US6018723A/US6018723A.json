    "abstract": "Methods and apparatus for transforming scoreable transaction data into financial data features are disclosed. In one aspect, a computer-implemented method transforms transaction data into a financial data feature for assessing credit risks. The financial data feature is extracted from the transaction data. The method involves obtaining the transaction data from a data source, and performing a set of operations on the transaction data to transform the transaction data into the financial data feature. The set of operations is selected only from a predefined set of classes of operations which are interrelated by a predefined order of precedence. Each operation in the set of operations is performed in an order based on the predefined order of precedence of a class associated with each operator.",

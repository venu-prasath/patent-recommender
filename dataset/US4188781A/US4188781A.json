    "title": "Non-linear dual mode regulator circuit",
    "abstract": "A control circuit is described for sensing and correcting deviations in speed of a turbine-generator. The control circuit compares actual turbine speed with a speed reference signal and provides a non-linear speed control signal to the turbine. The non-linear speed control signal is characterized by a first substantially constant slope for deviations in speed below a preselected deviation and a second substantially greater slope for deviations in speed above the preselected deviation. Substantially improved power system frequency regulation is thereby maintained.",

    "abstract": "Systems and methods for predicting user interaction with vehicles. A computing device receives an image and a video segment of a road scene, the first at least one of an image and a video segment being taken from a perspective of a participant in the road scene and then generates stimulus data based on the image and the video segment. Stimulus data is transmitted to a user interface and response data is received, which includes at least one of an action and a likelihood of the action corresponding to another participant in the road scene. The computing device aggregates a subset of the plurality of response data to form statistical data and a model is created based on the statistical data. The model is applied to another image or video segment and a prediction of user behavior in the another image or video segment is generated.",

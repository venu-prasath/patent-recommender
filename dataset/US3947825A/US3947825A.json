    "title": "Abstracting system for index search machine",
    "abstract": "The invention concerns a system of English language abstracting used to increase the search rate for an Index Search machine that, as an example makes use of magnetic record cards each having in a typical case 50 tracks for recording of information. To increase the rate at which groups of words can be compared, an abstract of each group of words is generated. On the magnetic card the text or groups of words are recorded on tracks 2 through 50 and the abstracts of these groups are recorded in track 1. When searching for a particular group of words, an abstract is generated for the group being sought. This abstract is then compared to the abstracts on track 1 of each card. If any of the abstracts match, the corresponding group of words on the card are searched in detail. For abstracts that do not match there is no need to search the corresponding group of words. Therefore, the need to search every group of words is eliminated, thus increasing the search rate.",

A method for generating in an information processing machine at least one abstract that is useful during information searching and retrieval procedures, comprising:\n1. sensing by said machine information signals representative of information comprising individual words in a selected language, each word comprising at least an individual character;\n2. developing in said machine signals representative of characters in said system;\n3. categorizing in said machine individual character signals into predefined character groups that are based on a probability distribution of the characters represented by said signals in the language selected;\n4. maintaining an abstract count by said machine of the number of character signals categorized into each of said predefined character groups;\n5. converting in said machine said abstract count to a compressed abstract count form; and\n1. sensing by said machine information signals representative of information comprising individual words in a selected language, each word comprising at least an individual character;\n2. developing in said machine signals representative of characters in said system;\n3. categorizing in said machine individual character signals into predefined character groups that are based on a probability distribution of the characters represented by said signals in the language selected;\n4. maintaining an abstract count by said machine of the number of character signals categorized into each of said predefined character groups;\n5. converting in said machine said abstract count to a compressed abstract count form; and\n6. storing said compressed abstract count in said machine as an abstract of said information.\n55. The method of claim 54 further comprising:\n7. providing in said machine an inquiry of information comprising at least an individual word in a selected language, said word comprising at least an individual inquiry character;\n8. developing in said machine inquiry signals representative of said at least an individual inquiry character;\n9. categorizing in said machine individual character inquiry signals into predefined character groups that are based on a probability distribution of the characters represented by said inquiry signals in the language selected;\n10. maintaining in said machine an inquiry count of the number of character inquiry signals categorized into each of said predefined character groups;\n11. reconverting in said machine said abstract count from compressed form to a character group count form like said inquiry count;\n12. comparing in said machine said inquiry count with said abstract count; and\n13. providing from said machine indication signals representative of a match or mismatch of said abstract and inquiry counts.\n7. providing in said machine an inquiry of information comprising at least an individual word in a selected language, said word comprising at least an individual inquiry character;\n8. developing in said machine inquiry signals representative of said at least an individual inquiry character;\n9. categorizing in said machine individual character inquiry signals into predefined character groups that are based on a probability distribution of the characters represented by said inquiry signals in the language selected;\n10. maintaining in said machine an inquiry count of the number of character inquiry signals categorized into each of said predefined character groups;\n11. reconverting in said machine said abstract count from compressed form to a character group count form like said inquiry count;\n12. comparing in said machine said inquiry count with said abstract count; and\n13. providing from said machine indication signals representative of a match or mismatch of said abstract and inquiry counts.\n56. The method of claim 55 wherein each abstract count comprises three non-compatible count characters, and further comprising:\n5a. compressing in said machine each abstract count into two apparatus-compatible characters.\n5a. compressing in said machine each abstract count into two apparatus-compatible characters.\n57. The method of claim 56 further comprising:\n7. generating and recording in said machine a special mark in each apparatus-compatible character to signify that it represents an abstract.\n7. generating and recording in said machine a special mark in each apparatus-compatible character to signify that it represents an abstract.",

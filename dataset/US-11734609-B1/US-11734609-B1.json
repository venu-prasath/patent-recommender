    "abstract": "Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on one or more computer storage devices, for training predictive models. Multiple training data records are received that each include an input data portion and an output data portion. A training data type is determined that corresponds to the training data. For example, a training data type can be determined by inputting the output data portions into one or more trained predictive classifiers. In other example, the training data type can be determined by comparison of the output data portions to data formats. Based on the determined training data type, a set of training functions are identified that are compatible with the training data of the determined training data type. The training data and the identified set of training functions are used to train multiple predictive models.",

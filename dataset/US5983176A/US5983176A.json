    "claims": "\n1. A method of determining if an audio file comprises music or speech comprising the steps:\nexamining time slices of said audio file to determine amplitude changes with time during each time slice;\nclassifying said audio file as music or speech based on said amplitude changes.\n2. The method as recited by claim 1 wherein said step of examining time slices comprise computing normalized amplitude deviation values for each time slice.\n3. The method as recited by claim 2 wherein said step of examining time slices further comprises averaging the normalized amplitude deviation values for all time slices to compute a music-speech metric.\n4. The method as recited by claim 2 wherein said step of computing a normalized deviation value comprises computing maximum amplitude for all time slices, computing a deviation from the maximum amplitude for a particular time slice and normalizing the deviation value.\n5. A method of analyzing audio file content comprising:\na) dividing said audio file into time segments of a predetermined size;\nb) computing values of normalized amplitude deviation with time during each time segment;\nc) averaging the normalized amplitude deviation values to compute a music speech metric; and\nd) assessing whether the audio file represents music or speech based on the music-speech metric value.\n6. The method as recited by claim 5 wherein said step of computing a normalized deviation value comprises computing an average maximum amplitude for each time slice, computing a deviation from the average maximum amplitude for a particular time slice and normalizing the deviation value.\n7. The method as recited by claim 5 wherein the step of normalizing the deviation value comprises:\na) computing a value MAX-DEV as the absolute value of the difference between the maximum amplitude of a time slice and the average maximum amplitude for all time;\nb) normalizing MAX-DEV over a reference value range by computing a value NORMALIZED-MAX-DEV=MAX-DEV*(REF-VAL/MAX) where REF-VAL is the maximum reference value in the range and MAX is the maximum amplitude for all time slices.\n8. A method of assessing the volume of an audio file comprising the steps of:\na) dividing said audio file into time slices;\nb) computing the average amplitude AVG-AMPLITUDE for each time slice;\nc) computing the average of the AVG-AMPLITUDE to provide a metric;\nd) assessing a volume level based on said metric.\n9. The method as recited by claim 8 wherein said value AVG-AMPLITUDE is computed by summing amplitude values in each time slice and dividing.\n10. A method of analyzing content of an audio file comprising the steps of:\na) assessing whether said audio file represents music or speech by examining slices of said audio file to determine amplitude changes with time during the time slice and classifying said audio file as music or speech based on said amplitude changes;\nb) assessing a volume level of said audio file.\n11. The method as recited by claim 10 wherein said step of examining time slices comprise computing normalized amplitude deviation values for each time slice.\n12. The method as recited by claim 11 wherein said step of examining time slices further comprises averaging the normalized amplitude deviation values for all time slices to compute a music-speech metric.\n13. The method as recited by claim 11 wherein said step of computing a normalized deviation value comprises computing an average maximum amplitude for each time slice, computing a deviation from the average maximum amplitude for a particular time slice and normalizing the deviation value.\n14. The method of claim 10 wherein said step assessing the volume of an audio file further comprises the steps of:\na) dividing said audio file into time slices;\nb) computing the average amplitude AVG-AMPLITUDE for each time slice;\nc) computing the average of the AVG-AMPLITUDES to provide a metric;\nd) assessing a volume level based on said metric.\n15. The method as recited by claim 14 wherein said value AVG-AMPLITUDE is computed by summing amplitude values in each time slice and dividing.",

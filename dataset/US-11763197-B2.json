    "abstract": "The present disclosure provides efficient communication techniques for transmission of model updates within a machine learning framework, such as, for example, a federated learning framework in which a high-quality centralized model is trained on training data distributed overt a large number of clients each with unreliable network connections and low computational power. In an example federated learning setting, in each of a plurality of rounds, each client independently updates the model based on its local data and communicates the updated model back to the server, where all the client-side updates are used to update a global model. The present disclosure provides systems and methods that reduce communication costs. In particular, the present disclosure provides at least: structured update approaches in which the model update is restricted to be small and sketched update approaches in which the model update is compressed before sending to the server.",

    "title": "Display device for indicating the value of a parameter in a process plant",
    "abstract": "An advanced control room complex for a nuclear power plant, including a discrete indicator and alarm system (72) which is nuclear qualified for rapid response to changes in plant parameters and a component control system (64) which together provide a discrete monitoring and control capability at a panel (14-22, 26, 28) in the control room (10). A separate data processing system (70), which need not be nuclear qualified, provides integrated and overview information to the control room and to each panel, through CRTs (84) and a large, overhead integrated process status overview board (24). The discrete indicator and alarm system (72) and the data processing system (70) receive inputs from common plant sensors and validate the sensor outputs to arrive at a representative value of the parameter for use by the operator during both normal and accident conditions, thereby avoiding the need for him to assimilate data from each sensor individually. The integrated process status board (24) is at the apex of an information hierarchy that extends through four levels and provides access at each panel to the full display hierarchy. The control room panels are preferably of a modular construction, permitting the definition of inputs and outputs, the man machine interface, and the plant specific algorithms, to proceed in parallel with the fabrication of the panels, the installation of the equipment and the generic testing thereof.",

    "claims": "\n1. A display device for indicating the value of a parameter in a process plant having an indicator and alarm system, comprising:\na display screen;\ndigital processing means for producing a plurality of display fields on the display screen, receiving input signals originating from sensors responsive to changes in the parameter, computing derived values from the input signals, and producing output value images in some of the display fields commensurate with respective input signals and derived values;\nsome of said fields defining touch-sensitive selection means for selecting particular of said fields and particular of said values for display on said screen;\nwherein a first set of said fields define a first display page and a second set of fields define a second display page,\n(a) the first and second display pages each having,\na process value field for displaying one output value image,\na quality field for displaying the quality of said one output value,\na menu field defining a touch-sensitive menu selection target whereby the user can alternate the display between said first and second pages,\n(b) the first display page having,\na plurality of touch-sensitive sensor fields for displaying the identity of each sensor that generates an input signal for said parameter, such that touching one of said sensor fields causes the display of the corresponding value image in said process value field,\na touch sensitive calculation field for causing the display of a derived value of said parameter in said process value field,\na touch sensitive override field whereby the operator can specify which of the output values of said display device is to be used as a representative value of the parameter in the indicator and alarm system,\n(c) the second display page having an analog field in which at least one analog representation of the value in the process value field is displayed.\n2. The device of claim 1, wherein the sensor fields include displays which identify at least one sensor for each of at least two different range of values of the parameter.\n3. The device of claim 1, wherein the quality field can display one of at least three categories, including a first category indicating that the process parameter value has been derived form a plurality of sensor inputs and is deemed validated, a second category indicating that the process parameter value has been derived from a plurality of sensor inputs but cannot be validated, and a third category indicating that the process parameter value is one of the sensor values.",

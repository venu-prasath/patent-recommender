    "title": "System for predicting documents relevant to focus documents by spreading activation through network representations of a linked collection of documents",
    "abstract": "A system for extracting and analyzing information from a collection of linked documents at a locality to enable categorization of documents and prediction of documents relevant to a focus document. The system obtains and analyzes topology, usage and path information from for a collection at a locality, e.g. a web locality on the world wide web. For categorization, document meta information is represented as document vectors. Predefined criteria is applied to the document vectors to create lists of \"similar\" types of documents. For relevance prediction, networks representing topology, usage path and text similarity amongst the documents in the collection are created. A spreading activation technique is applied to the networks starting at a focus document to predict the documents relevant to the focus document. Using category and relevance prediction information, tools can be built to enable a user to more efficiently traverse through the collection of linked documents.",

    "claims": "\n1. A system for identifying documents relevant to a focus document in a linked collection of documents, said system comprising:\nmeans for obtaining raw data for said linked collection of documents, said raw data including usage data, topology data and content data;\nmeans for creating usage, topology and text similarity maps for said linked collection of documents from said raw data; and\nmeans for predicting a relevant set of documents for a subset of said linked collection of documents using one or more of said usage, topology and text similarity maps.\n2. The system as recited in claim 1 wherein said means for obtaining raw data for said linked collection of documents is further comprised of a first agent for traversing said linked collection of documents to obtain topology information and a second agent for obtaining usage statistics for said linked collection of documents.\n3. The system as recited in claim 2 wherein said means for creating usage, topology and text similarity maps is comprised of:\nmeans for creating a usage matrix wherein each row and column correspond to a document in said linked collection of documents and each intersection represents the number of times a user traversed from the document indicated by the row to the document indicated by said column;\nmeans for creating a topology matrix wherein each row and column correspond to a document in said linked collection of documents and each intersection indicates if there is a link between said document indicated by the row and the document indicated by the column;\nmeans for creating a text similarity matrix wherein each row and column correspond to a document in said linked collection of documents and each intersection indicates a measure of similarity between said document indicated by the row and the document indicated by the column.\n4. The system as recited in claim 3 wherein said means for predicting a relevant set of documents for a subset of said linked collection of documents is further comprised of means for spreading activation through one or more of said usage, topology and text similarity maps and means for identifying a predetermined number of corresponding documents having the most activation as said relevant set of documents.\n5. The system as recited in claim 4 wherein said means for predicting a relevant set of documents for a subset of said linked collection of documents is further comprised of means for spreading activation through one or more of said usage, topology and text similarity maps and means for identifying a predetermined number of corresponding documents having activation above a predetermined threshold as said relevant set of documents.\n6. The system as recited in claim 1 wherein said linked collection of documents is a Web locality.\n7. A method for identifying documents relevant to a focus document in a linked collection of documents, said method comprising the steps of:\na) obtaining raw data for said linked collection of documents, said raw data including topology information and usage information;\nb) generating text similarity information between documents in said linked collection of documents;\nc) creating a plurality of characteristic maps from said raw data and text similarity information, each of said plurality of characteristic maps indicating relationships between documents in said linked collection of documents;\nd) selecting one or more focus documents from said linked collection of documents;\ne) spreading activation starting at said one or more focus documents through one or more of said plurality of characteristic maps until activation settles into an asymptotic pattern; and\nf) identifying relevant documents as those meeting a predetermined activation criteria.\n8. The method as recited in claim 7 wherein said step of obtaining raw data for said linked collection of documents\na1) retrieving a web page;\na2) storing location information for said web page;\na3) parsing said web page to identify links to other web pages; and\na4) repeating steps a1)-a3) for each of said other web pages.\n9. The method as recited in claim 8 wherein said step of obtaining raw data for said linked collection of documents further comprising the steps of obtaining access data from said linked collection, said access data indicating when and from where documents in said linked collections have been accessed.\n10. The method as recited in claim 9 wherein said step of generating text similarity information is further comprised of the steps of:\nb1) tokenizing said documents in said linked collection of documents, said tokens representing a word; and\nb2) comparing the similarity of documents by comparing the tokens contained in a document to obtain similarity measure information.\n11. The method as recited in claim 10 wherein said step of creating a plurality of characteristic maps from said raw data and text similarity information is further comprised of the steps of:\nc1) for each characteristic creating a matrix where each row and column correspond to a document and the intersection of a row and column indicates a characteristic between documents;\nc2) generating topology characteristic information and usage path characteristic information from said raw data, said topology information for indicating if a document contains a link to another document and said usage path information indicating the number of times a document was accessed from another document; and\nc3) inserting the characteristic information between documents at each intersection point in the corresponding matrix.\n12. The method as recited in claim 7 wherein for said step of identifying relevant documents as those meeting a predetermined activation criteria, said predetermined criteria is an activation threshold value.\n13. The method as recited in claim 7 wherein for said step of identifying relevant documents as those meeting a predetermined activation criteria, said predetermined criteria is a predetermined number of most activated documents.",

    "title": "Portfolio optimization by means of resampled efficient frontiers",
    "abstract": "A method for evaluating an existing or putative portfolio having a plurality of assets. A mean-variance efficient portfolio is computed for a plurality of simulations of input data statistically consistent with an expected return and expected standard deviation of return, and each such portfolio is associated, by means of an index, with a specified portfolio on the mean variance efficient frontier. A statistical mean of the index-associated mean-variance efficient portfolios is used for evaluating a portfolio for consistency with a specified risk objective.",

    "abstract": "A third-party company may assist companies in providing natural language interfaces for their customers. To implement a natural language interface for a company, a configuration may be received that includes information, such as a list intents, seed messages for the intents, and hierarchical information of the intents. An intent classifier may be trained using the configuration, and the natural language interface may be deployed for use with customers. Usage data of the natural language classifier may be collected and used to improve the natural language interface. Messages corresponding to an intent may be clustered into clusters of similar messages, and a prototype message may be obtained for each cluster to provide a human understandable description of the cluster. The information about the clusters may be used to improve the natural language interface, such as by creating a new intent with a cluster or moving a cluster to a different intent.",

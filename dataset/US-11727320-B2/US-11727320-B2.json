    "abstract": "Transaction-enabled methods for providing provable access to a distributed ledger with a tokenized instruction set for polymer production processes are described. A method may include accessing a distributed ledger comprising an instruction set for a polymer production process and tokenizing the instruction set. The method may further include interpreting an instruction set access request and providing a provable access to the instruction set. The method may further include providing commands to a production tool of the polymer production process and recording the transaction on the distributed ledger.",
    "claims": "\n1.

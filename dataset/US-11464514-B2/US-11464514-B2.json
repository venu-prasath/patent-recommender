    "abstract": "A surgical stapling system for treating tissue of a patient is disclosed. The surgical stapling system comprises an end effector, a firing member, a motor, a RF transceiver configured to transmit RF signals, and a sensing array. The end effector comprises an elongate channel, an anvil rotatable relative to the elongate channel from an open position toward a closed position, and a staple cartridge removably positioned in the elongate channel. The staple cartridge comprises a plurality of staples removably stored therein. The firing member is movable between an unfired position and a fired position. The staples are deployed from the staple cartridge based on the firing member being moved toward the fired position. The motor is configured to drive the firing member toward the fired position. The sensing array is configured to sense compression of the tissue, properties of the tissue, and a presence of metallic elements within the tissue.",

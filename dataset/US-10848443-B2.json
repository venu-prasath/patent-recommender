    "abstract": "Embodiments of the disclosure provide systems and methods for utilizing chatbots to support interactions with human users and more particularly to using multiple chatbots from different communication channels and/or in different domains to support an interaction with a user on a single communication channel and/or in a single domain. Generally speaking, embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to allowing multiple chatbots that operate on different communication channels and/or in different domains to socialize amongst one another. This socialization of chatbots operating on different communication channels and/or in different domains allows each chatbot to call upon one another to help engage in a transaction with a customer. In addition to facilitating a communication session in which two or more chatbots are socialized together to help prepare coherent responses to user inputs, the socialization of chatbots can also facilitate the automated training of chatbots.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method for using multiple chatbots to support a contact center communication session, the method comprising:\nreceiving, by a recommendation engine executing on a server, a request for assistance from a first chatbot conducting the contact center communication session with a user;\nselecting, by the recommendation engine executing on the server, a second chatbot from a plurality of chatbots;\ndirecting, by the recommendation engine executing on the server, the received request for assistance from the first chatbot to the selected second chatbot;\nmonitoring, by the recommendation engine executing on the server, a response to the received request for assistance generated by the selected second chatbot and sent to the first chatbot by the second chatbot; and\nreceiving by the recommendation engine executing on the server, feedback from the first chatbot, the feedback based on a result of using the response generated by the selected second chatbot, wherein the feedback is used to facilitate automated training of other chatbots of the plurality of chatbots.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein the received request for assistance from the first chatbot comprises a question or user input to which the first chatbot cannot respond with at least a predetermined amount of certainty.\n3. The method of claim 2, wherein the response to the request for assistance generated by the selected second chatbot comprises an answer to the question or user input and a confidence score for the answer.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein selecting the second chatbot is based on the received request for assistance specifically identifying the second chatbot, and wherein the first chatbot specifically requests the second chatbot in the request for assistance based on previous use of one or more responses provided to the first chatbot by the second chatbot and after checking a rank of the second chatbot from the recommendation engine.\n5. The method of claim 1, wherein selecting the second chatbot comprises selecting the second chatbot from the plurality of chatbots based on a set of records for each chatbot of the plurality of chatbots.\n6. The method of claim 1, further comprising:\nwherein monitoring the response to the received request for assistance generated by the second chatbot further comprises updating, by the recommendation engine executing on the server, a set of records for the selected second chatbot.\n7. A method for conducting a contact center communication session with a user, the method comprising:\nreceiving, by a first chatbot conducting the communication session with the user, a question or input from the user;\ndetermining, by the first chatbot, to request assistance from a second chatbot of a plurality of chatbots with responding to the question or input from the user, wherein determining to request assistance is based on a certainty for a response to the question or input from the user generated by the first chatbot being less than a predetermined amount;\nin response to determining to request assistance from the second chatbot, sending a request for assistance message to a recommendation engine executing on a server, the request for assistance message comprising the question or input from the user;\nreceiving, by the first chatbot, from the second chatbot, a proposed response to the question or input from the user;\nusing, by the first chatbot, the proposed response received from the second chatbot in the communication session with the user; and\nproviding, by the first chatbot, feedback to the recommendation engine, the feedback based on a result of using the proposed response, wherein the feedback is used to facilitate automated training of other chatbots of the plurality of chatbots.\n8. The method of claim 7, further comprising:\nupdating, by the first chatbot, a set of information maintained by the first chatbot and related to the second chatbot.\n9. A system comprising:\na first chatbot comprising a processor and a memory coupled with and readable by the processor and storing therein a set of instructions which, when executed by the processor, causes the processor to conduct a communication session with a user, receive a question or input from the user during the communication session, determine to request assistance with responding to the question or input from the user, and in response to determining to request assistance, sending a request for assistance message comprising the question or input from the user; and\na server comprising a processor and a memory coupled with and readable by the processor and storing therein a set of instructions which, when executed by the processor, causes the processor to receive the request for assistance message from the first chatbot, select a second chatbot from a plurality of chatbots, direct the received request for assistance message from the first chatbot to the selected second chatbot, and monitor a response to the request for assistance message generated by the selected second chatbot and sent to the first chatbot by the selected second chatbot, and receive feedback from the first chatbot, the feedback based on a result of using the response to the request for assistance message by the first chatbot in the communication session with the user, and wherein the feedback is used to adjust mapping records used by the server.\n10. The system of claim 9, wherein the request for assistance message from the first chatbot comprises the question or user input and is generated by the first chatbot in response to determining the first chatbot cannot respond with at least a predetermined amount of certainty.\n11. The system of claim 9, wherein the response to the request for assistance message generated by the second chatbot comprises an answer to the question or input represented in the request for assistance and a confidence score for the answer.\n12. The system of claim 9, wherein selecting the second chatbot is based on the request specifically identifying the second chatbot, and wherein the first chatbot specifically requests the second chatbot in the request for assistance message based on previous use of one or more responses provided to the first chatbot by the second chatbot and after checking a rank of the second chatbot from the server.\n13. The system of claim 9, wherein selecting the second chatbot comprises selecting the second chatbot from the plurality of chatbots based on a set of records for each chatbot of the plurality of chatbots.\n14. The system of claim 9, wherein monitoring the response to the request for assistance generated by the second chatbot further comprises updating a set of records for the second chatbot.\n15. The system of claim 9, wherein the set of instructions executed by the processor of the first chatbot further cause the processor to update a set of information maintained by the first chatbot and related to the selected second chatbot."

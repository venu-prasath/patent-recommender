    "abstract": "A fraudulent business transaction application (FBTA) is provided for monitoring application based fraud. When a consumer supplies account access information in order to carry out an Internet business transaction, the FBTA uses an online fraud mitigation engine to detect phishing trusions and identity theft. Methods are also provided for calculating travel velocity and transcation frequency, which are useful for determining a fraudulent transaction.",

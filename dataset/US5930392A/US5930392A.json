    "title": "Classification technique using random decision forests",
    "abstract": "In a decision-forest classifier in accordance with the invention, a decision forest including multiple decision trees is used to classify \"seen\" training data and \"unseen\" data. Each individual tree performs an initial classification based on randomly selected subsets of the data. The classification outcomes by the individual trees are combined using a discriminant process in the decision-forest classier to render the ultimate classification decision.",

    "claims": "\n1. Apparatus for assigning an image to a selected one of a plurality of classes comprising:\na generator for generating a plurality of features based on the values of a plurality of pixels representing said image;\na first processor for randomly selecting subsets of features from said plurality of features,\nand for providing a plurality of sample points, each sample point corresponding to a different one of said subsets of features;\na plurality of decision-tree classifiers each including a plurality of nonterminal nodes, the nonterminal nodes of each decision-tree classifier, in response to at least one of said sample points, jointly rendering a classification of said image; and\na second processor for combining the rendered classifications from said plurality of decision-tree classifiers to determine said selected class to which said image is assigned.\n2. The apparatus of claim 4 wherein each feature is a function of the values of selected ones of said plurality of pixels.\n3. The apparatus of claim 2 wherein the selected pixels are neighbors to one another.\n4. A method for use in an apparatus comprising a plurality of decision-tree classifiers to assign an image to a selected one of a plurality of classes, each classifier including a plurality of nonterminal nodes, comprising the steps of:\ngenerating a plurality of features based on the values of a plurality of pixels representing said image;\nrandomly selecting subsets of features from said plurality of features;\nproviding a plurality of sample points, each sample point corresponding to a different one of said subsets of features;\njointly rendering by the nonterminal nodes of each decision-tree classifier a classification of said image in response to at least one of said sample points; and\ncombining the rendered classifications from said plurality of decision-tree classifiers to determine said selected class to which said image is assigned.\n5. The method of claim 4 wherein each feature is a function of the values of selected ones of said plurality of pixels.\n6. The method of claim 5 wherein the selected pixels are neighbors to one another.\n7. Apparatus for assigning an image to a selected one of a plurality of classes comprising:\nmeans for generating a plurality of features based on the values of a plurality of pixels representing said image;\nmeans for randomly selecting subsets of features from said plurality of features;\nmeans for providing a plurality of sample points, each sample point corresponding to a different one of said subsets of features;\na plurality of decision-tree classifiers each including a plurality of nonterminal nodes, the nonterminal nodes of each decision-tree classifier, in response to at least one of said sample points, jointly rendering a classification of said image; and\nmeans for combining the rendered classifications from said plurality of decision-tree classifiers to determine said selected class to which said image is assigned.\n8. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the first processor includes the plurality of decision-tree classifiers, the generator and the second processor.",

    "abstract": "A server system may match a segment of code for a code integration request to metadata about similar segments of code, wherein the metadata qualifies one or more outcomes of previous integration requests. The server may determine usage rights and rules based on the metadata, wherein some of the usage rights and rules have previously have been approved by a multi-approval workflow that enforces a predetermined process to authorize use of the segment of code for code segment integrations. The server may analyze the metadata to predict an integration score based at least in part on the usage rights and rules of the segments of code.

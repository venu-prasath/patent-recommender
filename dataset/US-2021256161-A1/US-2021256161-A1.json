    "abstract": "In particular embodiments, a data processing data inventory generation system is configured to: (1) generate a data model (e.g., a data inventory) for one or more data assets utilized by a particular organization; (2) generate a respective data inventory for each of the one or more data assets; and (3) map one or more relationships between one or more aspects of the data inventory, the one or more data assets, etc. within the data model. In particular embodiments, a data asset (e.g., data system, software application, etc.) may include any entity that collects, processes, contains, and/or transfers personal data (e.g., a software application, database, website, server, etc.). A data asset may include any software or device (e.g., server or servers) utilized by a particular entity for such data collection, processing, transfer, storage, etc. The system may then utilize the generated model to fulfil a data subject access request.",

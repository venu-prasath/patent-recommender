    "abstract": "A computing system is configured to receive location data from a wireless device of a user. Upon receiving a search request from the wireless device, the computing system utilizes the location data to determine one or more likely travel routes of the user of the wireless device. In response to the search request, the computing system may select one or more establishments based on the likely travel routes and location data associated with the one or more establishments. The computing system may further transmit to the wireless device information associated with the selected one or more establishments.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method comprising, by a server:\nreceiving a search request from a wireless device of a user;\nreceiving current location data associated with the wireless device;\ndetermining one or more likely travel routes of the user based at least on the current location data, one or more previous search requests from the wireless device for travel directions, and a database of map information;\nselecting, in response to the search request, one or more establishments from a plurality of establishments, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on (1) the one or more likely travel routes of the user, (2) location data associated with the one or more establishments, and (3) a determination that one or more contacts of the user on a social networking service have visited the one or more establishments; and\ntransmitting, to the wireless device, information associated with the selected one or more establishments.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on past location data of the wireless device, the past location data comprising (1) a frequency that the wireless device is located at the one or more establishments or one or more establishment types associated with the one or more establishments, or (2) an amount of time that the wireless device is located at the one or more establishments or one or more establishment types associated with the one or more establishments.\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on one or more ratings of the one or more establishments or one or more establishment types associated with the one or more establishments, the one or more ratings being provided by the user on the social networking service.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on the transmitted information associated with the selected one or more establishments, the information comprising an hours of operation of the one or more establishments.\n5. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining that the wireless device is traveling in a vehicle, wherein the transmitted information associated with the selected one or more establishments comprises driving directions to the selected one or more establishments.\n6. The method of claim 5, further comprising determining a current heading of the vehicle, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on the current heading of the vehicle.\n7. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining that the user of the wireless device is walking, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on a predetermined radial distance from a current location of the wireless device.\n8. One or more computer-readable non-transitory storage media comprising software that is operable when executed by a server to:\nreceive a search request from a wireless device of a user;\nreceive current location data associated with the wireless device;\ndetermine one or more likely travel routes of the user based at least on the current location data, one or more previous search requests from the wireless device for travel directions, and a database of map information;\nselect, in response to the search request, one or more establishments from a plurality of establishments, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on (1) the one or more likely travel routes of the user, (2) location data associated with the one or more establishments, and (3) a determination that one or more contacts of the user on a social networking service have visited the one or more establishments; and\ntransmit, to the wireless device, information associated with the selected one or more establishments.\n9. The media of claim 8, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on past location data of the wireless device, the past location data comprising (1) a frequency that the wireless device is located at the one or more establishments or one or more establishment types associated with the one or more establishments, or (2) an amount of time that the wireless device is located at the one or more establishments or one or more establishment types associated with the one or more establishments.\n10. The media of claim 8, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on one or more ratings of the one or more establishments or one or more establishment types associated with the one or more establishments, the one or more ratings being provided by the user on the social networking service.\n11. The media of claim 8, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on the transmitted information associated with the selected one or more establishments, the information comprising an hours of operation of the one or more establishments.\n12. The media of claim 8, wherein the software is further operable when executed to determine that the wireless device is traveling in a vehicle, wherein the transmitted information associated with the selected one or more establishments comprises driving directions to the selected one or more establishments.\n13. The media of claim 12, wherein the software is further operable when executed to determine a current heading of the vehicle, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on the current heading of the vehicle.\n14. The media of claim 8, wherein the software is further operable when executed to determine that the user of the wireless device is walking, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on a predetermined radial distance from a current location of the wireless device.\n15. A system comprising:\none or more processors; and\none or more computer-readable non-transitory storage media coupled to one or more of the processors and comprising instructions operable when executed by one or more of the processors to cause the system to:\nreceive a search request from a wireless device of a user;\nreceive current location data associated with the wireless device;\ndetermine one or more likely travel routes of the user based at least on the current location data, one or more previous search requests from the wireless device for travel directions, and a database of map information;\nselect, in response to the search request, one or more establishments from a plurality of establishments, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on (1) the one or more likely travel routes of the user, (2) location data associated with the one or more establishments, and (3) a determination that one or more contacts of the user on a social networking service have visited the one or more establishments; and\ntransmit, to the wireless device, information associated with the selected one or more establishments.\n16. The system of claim 15, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on past location data of the wireless device, the past location data comprising (1) a frequency that the wireless device is located at the one or more establishments or one or more establishment types associated with the one or more establishments, or (2) an amount of time that the wireless device is located at the one or more establishments or one or more establishment types associated with the one or more establishments.\n17. The system of claim 15, wherein the one or more establishments are selected based on one or more ratings of the one or more establishments or one or more establishment types associated with the one or more establishments, the one or more ratings being provided by the user on the social networking service.\n18.

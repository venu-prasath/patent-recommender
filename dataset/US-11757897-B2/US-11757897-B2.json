    "abstract": "A blockchain of block entries that can be requested by users from user devices is maintained in a distributed network of nodes. Block entries include a plurality of data portions that are each associated with an access level. A request from an auditor to view one or more data portions of a block entry can includes an access code associated with at least one access level can be evaluated to identify one or more data portions associated with the access level. A customized view of the block entry which includes the one or more data portions associated with the access level can be generated. An artificial intelligence engine can review entries within the distributed ledger, identify earnings information associated with the sales of the commercial inventory, determine tax based on earning information, and pay the tax via fiat or cryptocurrency to government authorities based on earnings information.",
    "claims": "\n1. A system for tracking, management, and assuring fulfillment of tax payments to government entities based on earnings from commercial inventory, comprising:\na network of nodes communicably coupled to endpoints in a distributed network,\nwherein the network of nodes maintains a distributed ledger with entries from one or more endpoints,\nwherein the entries include: entries from customers relating to commercial inventory offered by an inventory provider, entries from the commercial inventory provider regarding an availability status of the commercial inventory, and earnings from sales of the commercial inventory, and\nwherein a marker is associated with each entry identifying an access level needed to review the entry;\na communications component supporting at least one of: receiving a request from a tax auditor to view earnings entries associated with sales of commercial inventory stored in the distributed ledger, wherein the request includes an access code associated with at least one access level associated with the tax auditor, or paying tax to government authorities;\nan access control layer to evaluate the access code in the request received via the communications component and to identify segments within the one or more entries stored on the distributed ledger that are accessible with the at least one access level provided in the request; and\nan access platform or decentralized application to generate a customized view of the segments within the one or more entries maintained in the distributed ledger.\n2. The system of claim 1, further comprising a codex configured to obfuscate identifying information of a user making the request to view at least a portion of the one or more entries.\n3. The system of claim 1, further comprising an artificial intelligence engine configured to review entries within the distributed ledger, identify earnings information associated with the sales of the commercial inventory, and assign an access level needed for a tax auditor to review each of the entries.\n4. The system of claim 3, wherein the artificial intelligence engine classifies data within each of the entries into one or more categories.\n5. The system of claim 4, wherein the access control layer then sets a different encryption level for each of the one or more categories of data classified by the artificial intelligence engine.\n6. The system of claim 4, wherein the one or more categories include earnings information, sales information, e-mail addresses, account numbers, balances, parties of a transaction, mailing addresses, vehicle identification numbers, license plate numbers, biometrics, driver's license numbers, photographs, or social security numbers.\n7. The system of claim 4, wherein the commercial inventory includes at least one of parking spaces in a parking facility, rooms in a hotel, package deliveries, game results, payments on gaming results, autonomous vehicles for hire, and a retail sale.\n8. The system of claim 1, further comprising an artificial intelligence engine to review entries within the distributed ledger, identify earnings information associated with the sales of the commercial inventory, determine tax based on earning information, and pay tax to government authorities based on earnings information.\n9. The system of claim 8, wherein the payment is made via at least one of fiat or cryptocurrency in the form of a stable coin.\n10. The system of claim 1, wherein the access level associated with segments within the one or more entries includes at least one of a private access level, a permissive access level, or a public access level.\n11. A method for tracking, management, and assuring fulfillment of tax payments to government entities based on earnings from commercial inventory, comprising:\nproviding access to a network of nodes communicably coupled to endpoints in a distributed network,\nwherein the network of nodes maintains a distributed ledger with entries from one or more endpoints,\nwherein the entries include: entries from customers relating to commercial inventory offered by an inventory provider, entries from the commercial inventory provider regarding an availability status of the commercial inventory, and earnings from sales of the commercial inventory, and\nwherein a marker is associated with each entry identifying an access level needed to review the entry;\nproviding an artificial intelligence engine to review entries within the distributed ledger, identify earnings information associated with the sales of the commercial inventory, determine tax based on earning information, and pay tax to government authorities based on earnings information;\nproviding a communications component to support at least of: receiving a request from a tax auditor to view earnings entries associated with sales of commercial inventory stored in the distributed ledger, wherein the request includes an access code associated with at least one access level associated with the tax auditor, or paying tax to government authorities;\nproviding an access control layer to evaluate the access code in the request received via the communications component and to identify segments within the one or more entries stored on the distributed ledger that are accessible with the at least one access level provided in the request; and\nproviding an access platform or decentralized application to generate a customized view of the segments within the one or more entries maintained in the distributed ledger.\n12. The method of claim 11, wherein evaluating the access code in the request with the blockchain of block entries includes processing an encrypted code to validate access to view the one or more data portions associated with the access level.\n13. The method of claim 11, further comprising providing a codex configured to obfuscate identifying information of a user making the request to view at least a portion of the one or more entries.\n14. The method of claim 11, further comprising:\nreceiving data from one or more endpoints;\nsegmenting the data from the one or more endpoints using the artificial intelligence engine; and\nautomatically assigning at least one access level to each segment of the data.\n15. The method of claim 11, wherein the artificial intelligence engine classifies data within each of the one or more entries into one or more categories.\n16. The method of claim 15, wherein the one or more categories include earnings information, sales information, e-mail addresses, account numbers, balances, parties of a transaction, mailing addresses, vehicle identification numbers, license plate numbers, biometrics, driver's license numbers, photographs, or social security numbers.\n17. The method of claim 11, wherein the commercial inventory includes at least one of parking spaces in a parking facility, rooms in a hotel, package deliveries, game results, payments on gaming results, autonomous vehicles for hire, and a retail sale.\n18. The system of claim 8, wherein the payment is made via at least one of fiat or cryptocurrency in the form of a stable coin.\n19.

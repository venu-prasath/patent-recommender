    "abstract": "Systems, methods, devices, server computers, storage media, and instructions for prioritized device action triggered by device scan data are described. In one embodiment, a mobile device performs a method that involves executing a messaging application with an image capture interface and a scanning input. An associated scanning mode comprises capture of scan data from a plurality of input/output modules of the first client device, analyzes the scan data to identify one or more scan data patterns by matching at least a portion of the scan data against a set of data patterns, and selects a priority system action based on the results of the matching of the portion of the scan data against the set of data patterns. In some embodiments, the priority system action is selected based on a priority ranking for identified scan data types.",
    "claims": "\n1. A method comprising:\ncausing, by a processor, an input device to capture scan data;\nmatching the scan data with a plurality of data patterns to identify a plurality of identified data patterns of the plurality of data patterns;\nselecting a first identified data pattern of the plurality of identified data patterns based on a pattern type ranking, wherein the plurality of identified data patterns is associated with a plurality of system actions, and wherein the first identified data pattern is associated with a first system action of the plurality of system actions; and\ncausing to be displayed, by a client device, an indication of the first system action.\n2. The method of claim 1 wherein causing to be displayed further comprises:\ncausing to be displayed on a display of the client device an interface including an option to perform the first system action.\n3. The method of claim 1 wherein, the input device is a camera, the scan data comprises an image comprising a scan code, and the pattern type ranking comprises a first level ranking for a scan code pattern.\n4. The method of claim 1 wherein the plurality of data patterns comprises:\nthe scan code pattern;\nan audio signature pattern;\na logo pattern;\na register trademark pattern;\na pattern associated with a third-party registered keyword; and\na pattern associated with a system keyword.\n5. The method of claim 1 wherein the input device is one of a plurality of input devices and the capture data is one of a plurality of capture data captured by the plurality of input devices.\n6. The method of claim 5 wherein the plurality of input devices comprises two or more of the following group:\na camera device, a position sensor, a temperature sensor, a motion sensor, a microphone, and a wireless communication device.\n7. The method of claim 5 wherein the plurality of scan data comprises two or more of the following group:\nwireless access point name data, image data, video data, audio data, location data, temperature data, and motion data.\n8. The method of claim 1 further comprising:\nin response to the matching the scan data with the plurality of data patterns failing to find a match, communicating the scan data to a third-party search server, and\nreceiving the first system action from the third-party search server.\n9. The method of claim 1 before the matching further comprising:\nanalyzing, using the processor, the scan data to identity one or more objects in the scan data, and wherein the matching further comprising:\nmatching the one or more objects of the scan data with a plurality of data patterns to identify a plurality of identified data patterns of the plurality of data patterns.\n10. The method of claim 9 wherein the analyzing is performed with a neural network trained to identify the one or more objects from images.\n11. The method of claim 1 wherein the system action comprises performing an image search using keywords associated with the one or more objects, and wherein the causing further comprises:\ncausing to be displayed an image search interface on a display of the client device with images from a local image gallery of the user device.\n12. The method of claim 1 before the matching further comprising:\nanalyzing, using the processor, the scan data to identity one or more objects in the scan data, and wherein the matching further comprising:\nmatching the one or more objects of the scan data with a plurality of data patterns to identify a plurality of identified data patterns of the plurality of data patterns, and wherein the one or more objects are associated with one or more keywords.\n13.

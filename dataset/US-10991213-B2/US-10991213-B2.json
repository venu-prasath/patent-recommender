    "abstract": "Various arrangements for assessing an installation of a smart home device are presented. An orientation of the smart home device may be analyzed to determine whether the orientation of the smart home device is unsuitable for one or more features of the smart home device to function properly. An indication of whether the orientation of the smart home device is unsuitable may be output, such as by the smart home device using voice or lighting.",
    "claims": "1.

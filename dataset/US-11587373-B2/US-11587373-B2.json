    "abstract": "In particular embodiments, a computing system may determine a predicted amount of ride requests for a plurality of collectively-managed vehicles and determine an availability of the collectively-managed vehicles to satisfy the predicted amount of ride requests. Subsequent to determining that the availability fails to satisfy one or more predetermined criteria for servicing the predicted amount of ride requests, the system may determine status information associated with the collectively-managed vehicles and determine, based on at least the status information, one or more minimum services for servicing one or more vehicles among the plurality of collectively-managed vehicles at one or more service centers such that the availability satisfies the one or more predetermined criteria. The system may instruct the one or more vehicles that are to receive the one or more minimum services to travel to the one or more service centers to be serviced.",
